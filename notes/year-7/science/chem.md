## Year 7 Chemistry Notes
#### Introduction
Matter
- Takes up space
- Has mass
- Is made of atoms - the smallest particles of matter
- Energy is not made of matter, but everything else is

Video:
- Matter is anything that has weight and takes up space
- Matter comes in different states
- Liquid, solid, gas
- If someone says that something doesnâ€™t matter, say everything is matter!

Atom
- The smallest particles of matter
- Made of subatomic particles
- Has a nucleus, containing protons (positive charge) and neutrons (negative charge)
- Has electrons in orbits around the nucleus
- Not simple

Video:
- Fill your room with grains of rice
- Zoom in on one grain so its as big is your room
- Fill that grain so it is filled with more grains of rice
- Between those rice, fill the space with fine grains of sand
- One fine sand is as big as an atom
- All atoms in humanity fit in a teaspoon

Molecules
- Atoms can form chemical bonds - unstable atoms can be attached to other unstable atoms
- Two of more atoms chemically bonded together is called a molecule
- Atoms of the same element can bond together
	- Eg Oxygen is made up of O2 molecules
- Atoms of different elements can be bonded together
	- Eg Water is made of H2O molecules

Elements
- Elements are made up of one type of atom (i.e. all their atoms are the same
- Elements cannot be broken into anything simpler
- There are 118 elements (94 occur naturally, others are man-made)
- Elements are found on the Periodic Table
- Each element has a unique chemical symbol
- Elements can be made of molecules

Compounds
- A compound is made of more than one element chemically bonded together
- Compounds can be described by a chemical formula - this states which atoms are in one unit of the compound (e.g. NaCl)
- Not all compounds are made up of molecules, but many are (e.g. H2O)

Pure Substance
- A pure substance has a constance chemical composition (the substance is made of the same stuff throughout)
- Pure substances can be describes with a chemical formula
- Elements and compounds are both pure substances
- Pure substances have constant chemical and physical properties(e.g. melting point, boiling point, density)

Impure Substances
- The opposite of pure substances
- An impure substance has a non-constant chemical composition (the substance is made of different things throughout)
