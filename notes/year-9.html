  <h4>Reflection</h4>
  <p>It was... a very wild ride. Met lots of new people (thanks to my year 10 music class) and did... not actually that many things.<br><br><strong>Puffs Production</strong><br>In this production, I took on the role of assistant stage manager! It was pretty crazy, learnt a lot about tech-ing, and gained some trauma from the battle scene with the rest of the biobox crew... (There were some very fast cues.) It was very fun nonetheless and drove me to do drama atar!<br><br><strong>Ningaloo Camp</strong>Honestly best camp ever. We snorkled every day, rode their glass bottom boat and swam with manta rays! We played Exploding Kittens with friends, Mr Mort and Ms Holland, and of course The Empireâ„¢ must get a special mention! (For the Empire!!!) Made lots of new friends and again, best camp ever.</p>
  <h4>Thoughts on Curriculum and Classes</h4>
  <p>In general, the curriculum this year was a lot more laid back than in year 7 and 8, probably because we were only doing year 10 content, rather than 1.5 years.</p>
  <p><strong>English</strong><br>I had Ms James again, and we covered speeches (the best unit), ancient literature, Shakespeare (also my favourite unit), sci-fi and documentary. It was a pretty fun unit in general, and my essay writing skills got drastically better (got my first A)! We had our first taste of lengthy and "action packed tests," where our sci-fi guided analysis was a very long test to be completed in 50 minutes. We had another essay writing test, which involved creating notes and writing the essay, spanning over 3 days (documentary). Our last long test was an overall test which covered grammer and vocabulary, analysing an image and writing either an essay or a short story.</p>
  <p><strong>Math</strong><br>Had Ms Liu, a new teacher who's teaching style I adore (unpopular opinion but yes). Had a very Mathspace based year, but she still white-board taught us, which was good. Has a very strong Chinese accent and took our class and myself a little bit of adjusting. I will miss the python investigations :(( they were so easy and it was so easy to get good mark with it since peer marking. RIP my grades next year I guess. However, I finally learnt what expanding brackets were. We had a year which was very focused on algebra and geometry (which we covered both in term 1 and 4) and my friend Joel carried my mark by tutoring me like the night before.</p>
  <p><strong>HaSS</strong><br>Had Ms Pyper, also a new teacher. She's quite nice and lenient, and very cool. However my geography grades dropped drastically (the test was absolutely ridiculous the class average was like 11/20 and one class got an average of 9/20). So glad I'm not doing HaSS in 2024. The course itself is interesting if you force yourself to be interested in it, otherwise it's very research based and quite plain.</p>
  <p><strong>Science</strong><br>Had Mr Mort again (in the double D class). Went into all the subjects in a lot more depth. Chem grade sky-highed this year so pretty happy with that. Otherwise everything else was quite average. The subjects which are new which we got was Human Biology, which replaced ESS. I found that writing SIS reports were significantly easy (although I spent ages writing those reports). The course itself, again, is quite chill and you are expected to practice the equations quite extensively (as I found after in the Physics test I skipped every single equation question), so it should be easy as long as you study consistantly.</p>
  <p><strong>Year 10 Music</strong><br>Mr Rogers for the third time... so it was a pretty boring year of singing rounds all the time in class and listening to debates between Mr Rogers and Finn. After the last exam, I learnt that you had to take notes about every single thing Mr Rogers says in class, no matter how off-topic or crazy it was. We were introduced to Jazz and Contemporary (in a very cram-style way at the end of each semester), and for WAM, we covered the Baroque and Classical periods. Our set works were: Vivaldi Spring mvt 1, Billie's Blues and Hound Dog for Semester 1, and Beethoven Pastorale mvt 1, In the mood (although it didn't appear in our exam, we got an unseen work which was Spiderman Theme instead) and Stand by Me and Baby It's You for Semester 2.</p>
  <p><strong>Japanese</strong><br>Had K Sensei for semester 1 and Matsuo Sensei for semester 2. K Sensei was kinda... incompetent when it came to controlling the class, and his teaching style wasn't as in depth as I'd like and he came off as not having lots of experience. Matsuo Sensei, however, was very cool and she's very nice but also teaches very well (not as good as Wee Sensei I loved her). Covered the milestones topic and fast foods topic and learnt about fishi ando chipusu. We had our first interview-style Japanese Speaking tests in semester 2 (that was hell) and our first unseen writing prompt (also hell, wrote 200 ji over the limit and didn't have enough time for everything else). Overall, the content learning pace was a bit slower than last year.</p>
  <p><strong>List of other subjects<br>Sport, health, aquatic rec (this was very fun I will 100% recommend), drama (also 100% recommend it's so fun to write your own crazy script and perform it)</p>
