## Viruses
Viruses
- Non cellular pathogens
- Not living
- Unable to reproduce without the help of a host cell
- Very simple
	- As small as 3 things
	- DNA/RNA (never both)
	- Nuclear acids and a protein coat known as capsid
- Envelops
	- Not part of virus
	- Hijacked from host cell
- Viruses can affect
	- Humans
	- Animals
	- Plants
	- Bacteria
- Different types of viruses rather than species
- Replicate rather than reproduce
- Can cause
	- Cold
	- Influenza
		- Worse than cold
	- Rabies
	- HIV/AIDs
	- Hepatitis B
	- Ebola Virus
	- Adenovirus
	- Bacteriophage
	- Papillomavirus
	- Rotavirus
	- Herpes

Types of viruses
- Helical
	- RNA
- Polyhedral
	- DNA
- Spherical
	- RNA
	- Standard
- Complex
	- DNA

Replication of virus
1. Attachment
	- Either whole virus enters the cell or just injects nucleic acids
2. Entry of virus nucleic acid into the host cell
3. Viral DNA/RNA enters the nucleus of the eukaryote host cell
	- Virus might break down
4. Viral DNA/RNA directs the host cell to replicate it and make copies of the viral proteins via translation
	- Tricks host cell
	- Might think it's its own DNA
5. New viral DNA/RNA and proteins assemble at the host's cell membrane
	- New viral particles assembled
	- Can produce multiple new viral particles
		- 100 something maybe even up to 1000s
	- Host cell will expel it out
	- Basically been exploded and it dies
