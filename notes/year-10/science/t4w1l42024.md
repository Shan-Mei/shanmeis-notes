## Pathogen
Pathogen
- Organism that causes disease

Bacteria
- Both pathogenic and and non pathogenic
- Bacterium (singular)
- Classifications (according to shape)
	- Spherical: Cocci
	- Spiral: Spirilla
	- Rod: Bacilli
		- What we draw
	- Curved rod: vibrio
- No need host cell
- Binary fission reproduction
	- Really fast
- Bacterial pathogen
	- Destroys host cells by competing with them
	- Producing exotoxins when metabolising
	- Releasing endotoxins when destroyed
	- Can still be harmful
- Some have flagellum/flagella
- Some have slime capsule

Plasmids
- Extention

Virus
- Not very beneficial
- We haven't found anything useful about viruses
- Not cellular
- Cannot reproduce and survive without host

Protists
- Something that doesn't fit into bacteria, virus and fungi
- Not cellular

Infectious
- Caused by pathogen

Contagious
- Passed from one to another

Infectious but not contagious
- Lime disease
- Cannot be passed on
- Caused by ticks

Eukaryote
- One or more cells which contain DNA and membrane bound nucleus
- Animals
- Plants
- Most protists
- Fungi

Prokaryote
- Unicellular
- DNA suspended freely
- Bacteria
- Archaea
