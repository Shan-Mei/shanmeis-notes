## Controlling infectious disease
What does it mean
- Reducing number of new infection
- Reducing disease prevalence (commonness)
- Completely eradicating the disease

Can be achieved by 
- Physical preventative measures
- Meds
- Vaccines

Physical preventatives
- Washing hands with soap
	- People often touch eyes nose mouth subconsciously
	- Pathogens can transfer to food/drink
	- Can be transferred to fomites
- Wearing gloves
	- Only work when used in appropriate circumstances
	- Cleaning/disinfecting around sick people and fomites
	- Contacting blood, stool, other body fluids
	- Dispose gloves after use
	- Wash hands after removing gloves
- Mask wearing
	- Barrier
	- Respirator droplets
	- Wash hands after handling a used mask

Medication
- Antibiotics
	- Drugs fight infections caused by bacteria eg penicillin
	- 2 kinds
		- Bactericidal antibiotics
			- Kill bacteria by disrupting
				- Cell wall
				- Cell membrane
				- Action of essential enzymes
		- Bacteriostatic antibiotics
			- Prevent bacteria from reproducing usually by disrupting protein synthesis
	- Broad spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria
	- Narrow spectrum is specific
	- Antibiotic resistance
		- Bacteria evolve to be resistant to antibiotics
		- From the overuse of antibiotics when unnecessary
- Medication antivirals
	- Treat virus infections
	- Inhibits replication of virus
		- Acyclovir for herpes
