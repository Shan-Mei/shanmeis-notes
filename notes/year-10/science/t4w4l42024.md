## Specific defence
Lymphocytes
- Produced in bone marrow - thymus and bone mature in diff places

Antigen
- Protein on surface of pathogens, cells, etc
- Elicits an immune response (foreign and non-self antigens)
	- Tolerates our own antigens

Immune system goal
- Restore internal environment to normal condition
- Humoral antibody-mediated response is to produce antibodies that attack pathogen
- Cell-mediated response - forms special lymphocytes that destroy pathogens

Antibody-mediate immunity
- B cells
	- Divide via mitosis
	- Produce plasma cells formed from on type of B cell
		- Secretes antibodies
	- Produce memory cells that spread to all tissues to allow immune response to occur more rapidly next time
	- 1st antigen encountered = primary response
- Produce antibodies to respond to non-self antigens
- Mature in bone marrow
- Antibodies
	- Globular protein which react to specific antigen
		- Immunoglobin
	- Binding only happen if antigen and antibody have complementary shapes

T cells
- Thousands respond to one particular antigen
- Produce cells rather than antibodies
- Mature in thymus
- When T cells meet antigen divide mitotically into 4 types of cells
	- Memory cells
		- Recognise og
	- Helper T cells
		- Secrete substances that cause lymphocytes to become sensitised
		- Attract macrophages to site of infection
	- Killer T-cells
		- Attach to invading cells and secrete substance to destry antigen
	- Suppressor T cells
		- General regulation of immune system
		- When infection is dealt with successfully, cells slow down immune response

Types of immunity
- Active
	- Produces own antibodies
		- Long term
		- Get disease and recover
- Passive
	- Receive antibodies from another source
		- Short term
		- Through placenta in colostrum (breast milk)
- Artificial active
	- Immunisations to activate immune system artificially
		- MMR
- Artificial passive
	- Injecting antibodies
