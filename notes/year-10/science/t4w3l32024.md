## 2nd line of defence
Cellular level

Inflammatory response
- Can occur for
	- Punctures skin
		- Opening
	- Cut yourself
	- Allergic reaction
	- Autoimmune disease
- 4 main signs
	- Heat
	- Swelling
	- Redness
	- Pain
- Major events in the local inflammatory response
	- Abnormal condition/mechanical damage
	- Mast cells are stimulated to produce chemicals
		- Histamine
			- Increases blood flow to injury site via vasodilation
				- Vasodilation - walls of capillaries and arterials dilating
				- More white blood cells
			- Allows walls of capillaries to become more permeable
				- More white blood cells (in fluid) can escape the capillaries to the tissue
				- The swelling
		- Heparin
			- No blood clotting at the injury site
				- Otherwise cells get clumped together and can't do their job
				- But allows clotting to occur surrounding the injury site
					- So pathogens that entered at the injury site can't spread to other areas of the body
		- Chemokines released attract more macrophages
			- Macrophages undergo phagocytosis
	- Cells undergo mitosis to replace any damaged cells
	- Pus get formed
		- Broken down cell debris
		- Stuff that has been digested but isn't needed any more

Types of blood cells
- Red
	- Carry oxygen
	- Don't really care in this unit
- White - leukocytes
	- Fighting infection and disease
	- Lymphocytes
		- T cells
		- B cells
	- Macrophages
		- Mast cells
		- They undergo phagocytosis
		- The "big dudes" that undergo phagocytosis
			- Undergo many times
			- Don't have many of them
			- Bigger better stronger than neutrophils
	- Neutrophils
		- Many of them
		- Small
		- Can undergo phagocytosis once
			- Sacrificial
		- Not as effective at their job

-itis suffix
- Something to do with tissues

Phagocytosis
1. Cytoplasm extends to surround bacteria which forms of phagosome
	- The lengthened bit is called pseudopods
2. Lysosome comes to secrete its lysozymes
3. Lysozyme fuses with phagosome to form phagolysosome

Fever
- Something in our brain (hypothalamus) controls body temperature
- When it increases our thermostat, hopefully it will kill pathogens
- When we feel cold
	- Hypothalamus resets thermostat to a higher level
		- Normal temperature might be 39 or 40
	- Our normal thermostat is 37 deg
		- So we're cold
	- Vasoconstriction
	- Shiver
- Crisis points
	- Fever breaks
	- Thermostat reset back to 37 deg
		- Really hot because you're at 39 deg or something
	- Vasodilation
	- If it doesn't reach crisis point then that's bad

Lysozyme
- Also in 2nd line

Interferons
- Outside of this course
- Inhibits viral replication
