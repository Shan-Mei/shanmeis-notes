## Test Review
Penetrating Power
- Alpha = low (paper)
- Beta = medium (aluminium)
- Gamma = high (concrete)

Interaction with electrically charged plates
- Alpha = deflected by positive charge, attracted to negative
- Beta = the opposite
- Gamma = no interaction

Alpha radiation hazard
- If it enters your body, it will ionise your body - organ damage

Graph
- Use 3/4
	- Title = Half life of carbon-14 OVER TIME

The total mass of the helium nucleus and the neutron is slightly less than the combined mass of the original deuterium and tritium nuclei. Explain why this is the case. In your answer, consider the relationship between mass and energy
- Explain that this lost mass is called mass defect
- Mass defect -> binding energy
- Einstein's equation E = mc^2
- This conversion releases a massive amount of energy
- Therefore the mass of constituent nucleons is less than that of the nucleus
