## Transmission of Pathogens
Direct transmission
- Touching the infected person

Indirect transmission
- Double dipping
- Sharing water bottles

Transmission of body fluids
- Saliva
- Blood

Infection by droplets
- **Inhaling** droplets in the air

Airborne transmission
- From coughing and sneezing

Infection and droplets and airborne transmission are basically the same

Transmission by vectors
- Such as malaria
- Mosquitos don't cause malaria (they don't actually have malaria)
- Just the bacteria on mosquitos
- Mosquito is the vector

#### Immune system
Non specific
- Defend against all kinds of bacteria
- 1st line of defence
	- Non specific external defences
	- Skin
		- Imperveous mechanical barrier
		- Slightly acidic
		- Produces sebum
		- Sweat
			- Preventing growth
			- pH
			- Temperatures
		- Provided you don't have a wound or cut it works pretty well
	- Mucous membranes
		- All our openings (nose, mouth, etc) all have them
		- Trapping pathogens
	- Cilia
		- Microscopic
		- Line trachea and nasal cavity
		- Works with mucus
		- Get pathogen out
		- Cilia beat them out by beating them towards an opening
		- Causes coughing and sneezing (to get them out) not necessarily always pathogens - dust, etc
		- Or forces you to swallow it down to get killed by stomach acid
	- Hairs in nose and hairs
		- If you can see it
	- Acids in stomach and vagina
		- Very acidic
		- Kills or hinders reproduction
	- Lysozyme
		- The enzyme lysozomes use to break things down
		- Tears, earwax, saliva, ears
		- Eyes protected by flushing action of tears
		- Urine out of urethra flushing action
		- Cerumen
			- Ear wax
			- Slightly acidic
- 2nd line of defence

Specific
- Defend against specific diseases
- Different cells
- 3rd line of defence

#### Protective Reflexes
Reflex
- Automatic involuntary response to a stimulus

Sneezing
- Irritation in nasal cavity

Cough
- Trachea and bronchi/ols

Vomit
- Psychologic stimulus - not related to disease and pathogens
- Food poisoning
	- Raw chicken
- Eating too much - stretching of stomach - not related

Diarrhoea
- Irritation of small and large intestines
- Stop absorbing water
- Fast expelling
