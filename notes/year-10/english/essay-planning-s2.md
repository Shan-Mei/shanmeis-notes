#### Generic conventions

	- Romaine's evidence that Vole came back at 20 past 9 page 11
- Follows an unassuming piece of evidence (the notes and the letter)
- Setting established early in the story
- False lead
	- People who can testify for Vole/others leaving/entering buildings
	- The letter for Shaws rents
- Denouement

#### Analysis Paragraph 1
Red herrings

Knives out
- Will reading scene 
	- Possible motives for murder throughout red herrings
		- Eliminates Ransom as one because he is at the will reading, albeit knowing he is not getting any share
		- Joni wants money
		- Linda wants the house
		- Walt wants Blood Like Wine
		- And they all had major arguments with Harlan before his death
			- Possibly "killing him before he can change the will"
	- Family positioning during the reading to show not only political divisions, but also to juxtapose what they want out of the will.

Witness for the Prosecution
- Romaine telling Mayherne "what if she told him he came back at quarter past 10"
	- She's an actress and cinema and theatre were very popular for post war Britain
	- "I hate him. I hate him. I hate him!"
		- Using her acting skills to draw herself as a red herring instead of Leonard
		- Also draws the audience, as Leonard and Mayherne have set Leonard up as innocent, to believe that Romaine wanted to frame Leonard - makes him look even more innocent

#### Analysis p2
Interrogating suspects

Witness for the Prosecution
- Romaine was interviewed in her home - which is not a very nice home
	- Housing improvements in 1920's.
		- Many people have "been there before" before the improvements in housing
		- Relatability for audiences to understand why Leonard killed Ms French
	- People understood Leonard and Romaine's struggles in why Leonard might have killed for the money
		- "Low water financially"


Knives out
- Donut hole in the wall of knives
	- Donut hole is seen through all of interrogation
	- Marta's head supposedly "fills" the hole during her interrogation
	- Hole can also be seen when first questioning about Blanc - he uses the donut hole analogy
	- Family members comment on how Marta, and immigrant, is a good girl
		- Split views around immigrants at the time
		- Filling of the donut hole represents other people's perspective on what immigrants are like. 
		- Leaves audiences to make their own decision
