### 1.1 - Key concepts
#### Space
Significance of location and spatial distribution  
How people organise and manage the spaces  
Kings park is the largest park in the world!  

#### Place
Significance of places and what they are like
- Range in size

#### Interconnection
Emphasis that no object of geographical study can be viewed in isolation
- History, etc

#### Change
Explaining geographical phenomena by investigating how they have developed over time
- Switching poles theory

#### Environment
Significance of environment in human life  
Human interaction and relationships with environment

#### Scale
The way geographical phenomena and problems can be examined at spatial levels

#### Sustainability
Capacity of the environment to continue supporting living things into the future

### 1.2 - 4 Spheres of Earth
#### Geosphere/Lithosphere
Rocks and minerals of earth
- If its made of solid earth, its part of the geosphere

#### Biosphere
Made of living things  
Made of biomes
- Deserts
- Forest
- Rainforest

#### Hydrosphere
Water on earth is part of this sphere
- Glaciers, underground
- Oceans, rivers, lakes
- Rain (but not clouds)

#### Atmosphere
All the gases on the planet
- The clouds and the wind is part of it

Split into many different sub-spheres
- Troposphere
- Stratosphere
- Mesosphere
- Thermosphere
- Exosphere

### 1.2 - Ecosystems
A self-sustaining system of living organisms which interact with each other and non-living things
- Tropical rainforest

All the living organisms in an ecosystem = plants and animals = biotic
- Aquatic and terrestrial categories
- Also subdivided into different trophs based on eating habits
	- Autotrophs: self-feeding
		- The core of all ecosystems because they don't need anything
		- Plants
	- Heterotrophs: consumers
		- Animals
	- Saprotrophs: decomposers
		- Bacteria and fungi

Non living things = abiotic
- Climatic: Air, sun, soil, climatic features
- Edaphic: Soil, minerals, topography
- Influential in controlling the ecosystem

#### Biotic
All the living organisms in an ecosystem = plants and animals

#### Dynamics
How energy is transferred through the system and the weather cycle  
Includes biogeochemical process  

#### Structure
What makes up an ecosystem

### 1.3 - Key terms in geography

### 1.4 - Revision
Outline the four main spheres of an ecosystem (2 marks): The four main spheres of an ecosystem is the lithosphere, the biosphere, the hydrosphere and the atmosphere. The lithosphere is comprised of solid, non living things. The biosphere is made of living things, the hydrosphere are liquids, and the atmosphere are the gasses.  
Define the term ecosystem and outline the structure of an ecosystem. (2 marks): An ecosystem is a self-sustaining system of living organisms which interact with each other and non-living things. The structure of an ecosystem comprises of autotrophs, heterotrophs and saprotrophs  
With reference to two components in the below diagram, outline the dynamics of an ecosystem and how components are interconnected: The components, fauna and vegetation, are interconnected in the dynamics of an ecosystem. Fauna will often eat vegetation that grows. All the components of the ecosystem dynamics are interconnected, by the components all directly effecting each other.

Using examples, distinguish between the terms ‘abiotic’ and ‘biotic’. (3 marks): Abiotic factors are the non-living things that influence an ecosystem. Biotic factors are the living things within the ecosystem. Climate is part of the abiotic section, and animals and plants are part of the biotic section.
