### Key concepts
#### Space
Significance of location and spatial distribution  
How people organise and manage the spaces  
Kings park is the largest park in the world!  

#### Place
Significance of places and what they are like
- Range in size

#### Interconnection
Emphasis that no object of geographical study can be viewed in isolation
- History, etc

#### Change
Explaining geographical phenomena by investigating how they have developed over time
- Switching poles theory

#### Environment
Significance of environment in human life  
Human interaction and relationships with environment

#### Scale
The way geographical phenomena and problems can be examined at spatial levels

#### Sustainability
Capacity of the environment to continue supporting living things into the future

### 4 Spheres of Earth
#### Geosphere/Lithosphere
Rocks and minerals of earth
- If its made of solid earth, its part of the geosphere

#### Biosphere
Made of living things  
Made of biomes
- Deserts
- Forest
- Rainforest

#### Hydrosphere
Water on earth is part of this sphere
- Glaciers, underground
- Oceans, rivers, lakes
- Rain (but not clouds)

#### Atmosphere
All the gases on the planet
- The clouds and the wind is part of it

Split into many different sub-spheres
- Troposphere
- Stratosphere
- Mesosphere
- Thermosphere
- Exosphere

### Ecosystems
A self-sustaining system of living organisms which interact with each other and non-living things
- Tropical rainforest

All the living organisms in an ecosystem = plants and animals = biotic
- Aquatic and terrestrial categories
- Also subdivided into different trophs based on eating habits
	- Autotrophs: self-feeding
		- The core of all ecosystems because they don't need anything
		- Plants
	- Heterotrophs: consumers
		- Animals
	- Saprotrophs: decomposers
		- Bacteria and fungi

Non living things = abiotic
- Climatic: Air, sun, soil, climatic features
- Edaphic: Soil, minerals, topography
- Influential in controlling the ecosystem

#### Biotic
All the living organisms in an ecosystem = plants and animals

#### Dynamics
How energy is transferred through the system and the weather cycle  
Includes biogeochemical process  

#### Structure
What makes up an ecosystem
