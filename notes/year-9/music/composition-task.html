  <h3>Reflection and Results</h3>
  <h4>Reflection</h4>
  <p>I wrote it the night before, once again... Not expecting over 95 for this, since it isn't really "proper" in terms of string quartet writing. I also am not used to writing analysis, I am used to writing performance notes.</p>
  <h4>Results</h4>
  <p>99. Huh. Well I am a bit disappointed because I am pretty used to receiving 100's. My composition itself got full marks but my analysis lost a mark... which annoys me. I feel like I shouldn't have submitted the full analysis, as it wasn't required. Oh well...</p>
