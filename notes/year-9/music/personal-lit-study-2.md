You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
- Lowly husband

Been snoopin' 'round my door
- Husband manipulating her

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog  
Been snoopin' 'round my door  
You can wag your tail  
But I ain't gonna feed you no more  

**Verse 1**  
You told me you was high class
- Husband tricking wife

But I could see through that
- Discovered he was lying

Yes, you told me you was high class  
But I could see through that  
And daddy I know  
You ain't no real cool cat  
- She doesn't like her husband

**Guitar Solo**  
Oh, play that thing, boy!  
Aw listen, isn't that them old hound dog? (Oh-woo!)  
Oh, play it, it's all right up here  
And listen to that old hound dog howl (Ooo-wo!)  
- She is spiting her husband

Oh, play it boy, play it  
Oh, you make me feel good  
Oh, do not mess around any longer daddy  
Now wag your tail  

Oh, get it  
Oh, get it now, get it, get it, get it  
Oh, you old hound dog  
- Called blues talk

**Verse 2**  
You made me feel so blue
- Husband made her sad

You made me weep and moan  
You made me feel so blue  
Yeah you made me weep and moan  
Cause you ain't looking for a woman  
All you're lookin' is for a home

Awoo!

Cryin' all the time  
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit  
And you ain't no friend of mine  
- Stupid dog

**Verse 1**  
Well, they said you was high-classed  
Well, that was just a lie
