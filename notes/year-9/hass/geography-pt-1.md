## Geography Test 1 Notes
### Ecosystems
#### Define the term "ecosystem"
My answer: an ecosystem is a self-sustaining economy of living things in a biome where there is interactions between living things and non-living things.  
Flashcard definition: A self-sustaining system of living organisms which interact with each other and the non-living components of the universe  

#### Explain the 4 spheres and how they interact with the ecosystem
My answer: The 4 spheres are the lithosphere, which is the top layer of rock on earth, the hydrosphere, all the water, including frozen and underground, on earth, the atmosphere, all the gasses on earth, and the biosphere, all the living things on earth. The biosphere is what makes the ecosystem the ecosystem: they interact with each other. The biosphere also interacts with the other spheres.

#### Using examples, distinguish between the terms "biotic" and "abiotic"
My answer: The biotic category of an ecosystem comprises of all the organisms within the ecosystem. The abiotic category are all the non-living things of the ecosystem. An example is a bird: a bird is a living organism and therefore part of the biotic category. The bird interacts with the abiotic components, for example water. 

#### *Define components of ecosystem*
My answer: Climate = the average temperature and rainfall of an area over a time period. Vegetation = The plants in an ecosystem. Fauna = The animals in an ecosystem. Landforms and drainage = The shape and contour of where the ecosystem is situated and the landforms within it. Soils = where the plants grow.  

#### *Explain how the components ensure ecological balance*
My answer: All the parts of the ecosystem components influence each other, and if one part is out of balance, it can affect all the components.

### Biomes
#### Define the term "biomes" and differentiate from "ecosystems"
My answer: Biomes are areas of land that are characterised by their vegetation. These are different from ecosystems because biomes are the places that ecosystems are situated.  
Flashcard definition: A large region characterised by their dominant vegetation

#### *List and briefly explain the different biomes we have investigated.*
My answer: Biomes that we have studied include forest and woodland biomes, grassland biomes, desert biomes, tundra biomes and alpine biomes. Woodland biomes are characterised by their high rainfall and dense vegetation. Grassland biomes generally contain lots of grass and ground cover, with some grassland trees. Desert biomes are characterised by their minimal rainfall, highly fluctuating temperatures between night and day and their minimal vegetation. Tundra biomes have harsh, desert like conditions. They are also extremely cold and have very little vegetation and no trees. Alpine biomes are located in high altitudes and are very cold, with little vegetation.

#### *Explain the spatial distribution of biomes across the Earth.*
Spatial distribution is the distribution of biomes across earth. It is affected by the climate of areas, for example, in a warm place with lots of rainfall would create a rainforest

### Climate
#### Define "climate" and differentiate from "weather"
My answer: Climate is the average conditions (temperature and rainfall) of a biome over an extended period of time, often over multiple years. The climate of a biome rarely changes, unlike weather, which is a measure of the atmosphere's conditions over a short time, like 2 weeks. They usually measure rainfall, humidity, temperature, wind, and other things.  
Flashcard definition: Climate is the average weather that occurs in a given region over a long period of time. Weather is the day-to-day conditions of the atmosphere, including temperature and precipitation.  

#### Explain the spatial distribution of climate across Earth.
The spatial distribution of climate is affected by the sun's rays and prevailing winds. The closer to the equator an area is, the warmer it is. If prevailing winds of an area comes from a hot/cold/dry/ocean area, then the receiving area will be affected by the winds. 

#### Using examples, explain the relationship between the spatial distribution of biomes and climate.
Certain climates create ideal conditions for particular vegetation to grow, and that will form the biomes. For example, if it is extremely hot and dry, desert plants and succulents are most likely to grow as they can withstand the heat.  

#### List and describe Koppen's climate classifications
My answer: Koppen's climate classification is a list of all of the climates on earth which uses a 2 - 3 letter code. It was first published in 1836. The first letter of each of the codes are either A, B, C, D or E. A means tropical, B means dry, C mean continental, D means mediterranean, E means polar. In temperate and continental climates, the second letter is either s, w or f. S means that the area's dry season is in summer, w meaning dry season is in winter, f meaning there is no dry season at all. The last letter is from a to d, a ranking of how warm a biome is. A means the warmest, d the coldest. The other classifications for the second letter are m, monsoon, W, desert, S, steppe, T, tundra and F, frost. Other third letters include h, hot arid and k, cold arid.

#### Explain the purpose of a climate graph.
A climate graph is a graph which shows the average temperatures and rainfall throughout a period of time (usually a year). The temperature is shown through a curved line which follows the average temperatures for each month, and precipitation is shows through a column graph with the average rainfall of each month.

#### Outline the 6 factors that influence climate
My answer: The 6 factors the influence climate are latitude, altitude, prevailing winds, distance from ocean, ocean current and geographical barriers. Latitude is the measure of your distance from the equator. The further from the equator are, the less sun you get, therefore a lower temperature. The altitude is the measure of distance from sea level, and the higher from sea level, the colder it is. Prevailing winds carry the climate of where the winds form, and if they are formed on the sea, they can carry rain. The distance a biome is from the ocean influences their condition fluctuations. If they are closer to the ocean, they have more seasonal and temperate climates and they have less temperature fluctuations between day and night. Ocean currents influence the temperature of coastal biomes. There are two kinds of ocean currents: cool ocean currents and warm ocean currents. Cool ocean currents cool the oceans that the current travels to, and the warm ocean currents warm a place up. Geographical barriers can influence a variety of things, like blocking wind, sunlight and rainfall. Especially on mountains, they have two sides: the windward side and the leeward side. The windward side would receive the most rainfall while the leeward side was generally dry and warmer.
