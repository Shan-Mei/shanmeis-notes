### Key concepts
#### Space
Significance of location and spatial distribution  
How people organise and manage the spaces  
Kings park is the largest park in the world!  

#### Place
Significance of places and what they are like
- Range in size

#### Interconnection
Emphasis that no object of geographical study can be viewed in isolation
- History, etc

#### Change
Explaining geographical phenomena by investigating how they have developed over time
- Switching poles theory

#### Environment
Significance of environment in human life  
Human interaction and relationships with environment

#### Scale
The way geographical phenomena and problems can be examined at spatial levels

#### Sustainability
Capacity of the environment to continue supporting living things into the future

### 4 Spheres of Earth
#### Geosphere/Lithosphere
Rocks and minerals of earth
- If its made of solid earth, its part of the geosphere

#### Biosphere
Made of living things  
Made of biomes
- Deserts
- Forest
- Rainforest

#### Hydrosphere
Water on earth is part of this sphere
- Glaciers, underground
- Oceans, rivers, lakes
- Rain (but not clouds)

#### Atmosphere
All the gases on the planet
- The clouds and the wind is part of it

Split into many different sub-spheres
- Troposphere
- Stratosphere
- Mesosphere
- Thermosphere
- Exosphere

### Ecosystems
A self-sustaining system of living organisms which interact with each other and non-living things
- Tropical rainforest

All the living organisms in an ecosystem = plants and animals = biotic
- Aquatic and terrestrial categories
- Also subdivided into different trophs based on eating habits
	- Autotrophs: self-feeding
		- The core of all ecosystems because they don't need anything
		- Plants
	- Heterotrophs: consumers
		- Animals
	- Saprotrophs: decomposers
		- Bacteria and fungi

Non living things = abiotic
- Climatic: Air, sun, soil, climatic features
- Edaphic: Soil, minerals, topography
- Influential in controlling the ecosystem

#### Biotic
All the living organisms in an ecosystem = plants and animals

#### Dynamics
How energy is transferred through the system and the weather cycle  
Includes biogeochemical process  

#### Structure
What makes up an ecosystem

### 1.4 - Revision
Outline the four main spheres of an ecosystem (2 marks): The four main spheres of an ecosystem is the lithosphere, the biosphere, the hydrosphere and the atmosphere. The lithosphere is comprised of solid, non living things. The biosphere is made of living things, the hydrosphere are liquids, and the atmosphere are the gasses.  
Define the term ecosystem and outline the structure of an ecosystem. (2 marks): An ecosystem is a self-sustaining system of living organisms which interact with each other and non-living things. The structure of an ecosystem comprises of autotrophs, heterotrophs and saprotrophs  
With reference to two components in the below diagram, outline the dynamics of an ecosystem and how components are interconnected: The components, fauna and vegetation, are interconnected in the dynamics of an ecosystem. Fauna will often eat vegetation that grows. All the components of the ecosystem dynamics are interconnected, by the components all directly effecting each other.

Using examples, distinguish between the terms ‘abiotic’ and ‘biotic’. (3 marks): Abiotic factors are the non-living things that influence an ecosystem. Biotic factors are the living things within the ecosystem. Climate is part of the abiotic section, and animals and plants are part of the biotic section.

### 2.1 Biomes
#### Video Deserts
Less than 10 inches of rainfall a year  
Subtropical
- Hottest - 120 degrees farenheit

Semiarid  
- Asia

Coastal
- Edges
- Still dry

Polar
- Arctic and antarctic

### Group Activity for biomes

### 2.3 - Spacial distribution of biomes

Seasonal Savannah/forest runs along the equator up to 30 both north and south  
Tropical rainforests run along the equator  
Temperate deciduous forests are located in 45deg W 38deg N, 30deg E and 52 N, 115deg E, 30deg N, 70deg W and 50deg S   
Taiga forests run between 45deg N and 68deg N in Asia, Europe and North America  
Temperate grasslands/desert occur between 20deg N and 52deg N in Asia, Europe and North America  
Subtropical deserts occur in 15deg N to 30deg N in Africa, 90 - 120deg W at 40deg E in north america and 38 - 18deg S at 110 - 150deg E in Australia.  
Shrublands occur along the western side of south America and 30-45deg N at 10deg W to 30deg E.  
Alpines are found along the west of south america, in a squiggly line from 38 - 52deg N at 120 - 105deg W. They also run along a slightly lopsided crescent shape from 30 - 45deg N at 75 - 105deg E and 30deg E at 8 - 15deg N.  
Tundras occur between 52 - 85deg N, not in Greenland  
Polar ice caps occur in Greenland.  
Tropical rainforests occur 52 - 30deg S at 75 - 50deg W in south America, 15deg E at 25deg S.<br><br>Climate is related to biomes. For example, desert climate will form a desert, and rainforest climate will result in a rainforest. This is because the climates form the ideal conditions for specific biomes to form.

### 3.1 - Climate
Biomes all have similar climates  
Climate = average weather conditions
- Temperature
- Precipitation

Climate affects biodiversity  
Graphing climate
- Has temperature and rainfall
- Red line = temperature
- Rainfall = blue coloured columns
	- Averages per month

### 3.2 - Classifying Climate
#### Video notes
Koppen-Geiger system
- Classifies a bunch of different climates
- Koppen zones
- 5 broad categories
	- A= Tropical = around equator
		- Hot or heavy rain all year round/seasonal
	- B= Dry = subtropical/continental
		- Little rain all year
	- C = Temperate = mid latitudes near coasts
		- Mild temp all year
	- D = Continental = Northern continents
		- High temp range
		- Cold/very cold winter
	- E = Polar = Poles
		- Cold
	- All are subdivided
- All are subdivided and given 2-3 digit codes
	- Examples
		- Af
		- BWh
		- Cfa
		- Dsd
		- Dfa
		- ET
- Interpreting codes
	- First letter is which of the 5 categories
	- Temperate and continental codes
		- Second letter = when is dry season
			- S = summer
			- W = winter
			- F = no dry season
		- Third letter = how hot/warm
			- a = hottest
			- d = coldest
	- All
		- Af = tropical rainforest
		- Am = tropical monsoon
		- Aw = tropical savannah
		- Bwh = hot desert
		- Bsh = hot semi-arid
		- BWk = cool desert
		- BSk = cool semi-arid
		- Cfa = humid subtropical
		- Cwa = subropical monsoon
		- Csa = hot summer mediterranean
		- Csb = warm summer mediterranean
		- Cwb/c = subtropical highlands
		- Cfb = ocean and subtropical highland
		- Cfc = subpolar oceanic
		- Dfa/b = humid continental
		- Dwa/b = continental monsoon
		- Dsa/b = continental dry summer
		- Dfc/d = subarctic
		- Dwc/d - subarctic monsoon
		- Dsc/d = subarctic dry summer
		- ET = tundra
		- EF = icecap

### 3.3 - Climate
Affected by 6 key factors = LAPDOG
- Latitude
- Altitude
- Prevailing winds
- Distance from sea
- Ocean currents
- Geographical barriers

Latitude
- Distance from equator
- degrees/minutes (generally degrees)
- Measures north or south of equator
- Doesn't really influence climate but
	- The closer to the equator you are, the warmer it is because solar isolation
	- Further away means cooler because sun is being dissipated
	- Depends on how sun's rays strike earth
		- Angle, length

Altitude
- Height above sea level
- Higher you are, the colder it gets
	- Decreased air pressure
	- Air particles expand
	- Uses up energy - lost to heat
	- Every 1000m above sea level temp drops by 6.5deg C

Prevailing winds
- Wind patterns in spec region
- Carry climate of area where they came from
- Two patters
	- Tropical "prevailing trade winds"
	- Subpolar "prevailing westerlies"
- Winds blowing from cold places cause cooler climates
	- And vice versa
- If they come from ocean they add more rain

Distance from ocean
- Coastal locations have more temperate seasonal climates (cooler in summer, warmer in winter)
	- Less temp fluctuations (day and night)

Ocean currents
- Continuous and directed movement of ocean water through earth
- Carry hot or cold water from one place to another
- Can also increase rainfall
- Cold ocean currents lowers temp and rainfall
- Gulf stream

Geographic barriers
- Mountain ranges
	- Affect rainfall by creating a barrier for clouds and rainfall
	- Force moist air to rise, causing air to cool and condense, rain falls.
	- Windward side
		- Where wind comes from
		- Receives most rainfall
	- Leeward side
		- Hot and dry
		- Less rainfall

Perth's climate
- Temperate Mediterranean
	- Hot summers cold winters
	- 700mm rainfall a year
	- From 7 deg to 32 deg in summer
- Latitude = 30 deg south (3500 km)
	- Outside of tropic of capricorn and in the temperate belt
	- Between tropical and subpolar zones
- Altitude = at sea level
	- No mountains
	- Boring :(
	- Higher rainfall at foot of darling ranges
- Prevailing winds - seasonal
	- Stronger westerlies in winter
		- Cold antarctic air
		- rain
	- Dry air in summer
		- From desert
	- Fremantle doctor every day in summer
		- Cools perth up to 10 deg
		- Pressure between land and sea causes cold wind
- Ocean currents = west australian current
	- From antarctica = cool
	- Keeps climate mild in summer and wet in winter
	- Ensures we get dry weather rather than humid (lucky us)
- Geographical barriers
	- No major ones except darling ranges
	- Rainfall spread evenly across region
	- Higher rainfall at foot of darling ranges
