  <h3>The speech</h3>
  <h4>How Damaging is Modern Slavery to Australia?</h4>
  <p>Distinguished guests, members of parliament, and all our valued members of the public present today, I ask – How damaging is modern slavery to Australia? My name is Shan-MeiWan, and I am speaking on behalf of Anti-Slavery Australia.</p>
  <p>As decreed in Australian law: "Everyone has a right to freedom from forced labour and slavery." Yet, 150000 people in Australia are living in modern day slavery, including instances of human trafficking and forced labour. This is a completely unacceptable statistic for a supposedly developed country, especially a country where values of fair play and freedom are so predominant.</p>
  <p>So, why don't we do something about this malicious act of injustice? According to Australian statistics, only 1 in 5 people living in slavery are identified and assisted, and the majority of violators are never prosecuted. Because of this, thousands of people are suffering from long hours of work and harsh conditions, and are neglected and punished by society, you and me - yes, these people are suffering alone, thinking there is no one who can help them, thinking they cannot escape the situation they are in. They are being held hostage in a prison, and they have been exploited by their masters and have been materialised and dehumanised - this is the definition of slavery, according to the law.</p>
  <p>Let me tell you about one of our former clients, Jai. He was trained as a chef in India. Upon hearing that his boss also owned a restaurant in Australia he travelled here on a working visa, funded by his boss. However, all of Jai's hopes were crushed as he was forced to live in the kitchen. He worked 16 hours every day, and he was only allowed what is less than rations to chew on, and wasn’t allowed any breaks. And what has this earned him? His boss locks him in the janitor's cupboard after his work, with no bathroom, no food, no water and no payment. After many years, people treat him like a sub-human, if not human at all. He has scars all over his body from abuse from his co-workers and boss, and his bones jut out almost as much as anyone's in the rural areas of developing countries. He has a frown permanently fixated on his face, and his eyelids sag with exhaustion. - can anyone here bear seeing such cruelty?</p>
  <p>My fellow Australians, is this what it means to be Australian?</p>
  <p>To be exploited for our personal gain, without caring about others?</p>
  <p>How damaging is modern slavery in Australia and our reputation as a country?</p>
  <p>It had already been a few gruesome years when Jai finally sought help from Anti-Slavery Australia. However, Jai's health was already extremely poor, and having no money, his health steadily declined until he passed away a few years later. And why has this all happened? His boss's insatiable desire for money. </p>
  <p>Many of you may think that Jai's boss was put into jail and punished by the law. But alas, he was not. Out of 150000 slaveries, only 31 people have been punished for breaking this law. This staggering difference indicates that many poor souls will continue to suffer - that's not very Australian, is it?</p>
  <p>Members of Parliament, I ask you to bring this issue up at your next meeting. I ask you to take a step up in your law enforcement programs. Today, I declare that Australia’s officials will make a true attempt to track down a slave master when a slave has been identified by Anti-Slavery Australia. Today, I declare that different parts of the government can work together in stopping slavery, that being us and the police force.</p>
  <p>Members of the public, I ask you to spread the word. If anyone has recorded the speech, I encourage you to share it to any Australian audience, and together, we can bring this issue into light.</p>
  <p>Together, we can stop slavery, and push Australia closer towards freedom. Together, we can stop the slave masters and free the people who have been manipulated into a living nightmare. Together, we can truly become one and free.</p>
  <p>Thank you.</p>
