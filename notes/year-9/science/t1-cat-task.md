  <h4>Variables</h4>
  <p>Independant Variable: Voltage of the power supply (v)<br>Dependant variable: The current in series (I)<br>Controlled Variables: The resistance of the variable resistor (Ohms), resistance of the wire (Ohms), material of the wire.</p>
  <h4>Research</h4>
  <h5>1. What is Ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>Ohmic resistance is the sum of the resistors, resistance of the current collector, the active mass and the resistance of the wires. Basically, It is the resistance of every part of the circuit combined.</p>
  <h5>2. What is non-Ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>Non-Ohmic resistance is resistance that doesn't follow Ohm's law (V = I/R), such as temperature.</p>
  <h5>3. How can we tell if a material has ohmic or non-ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>A resistor is ohmic if when the voltage is increased with it across the circuit, and when graphed, the line is straight, then it is ohmic. If the line is not straight, but has curves, then the resistor is non-ohmic.</p>
  <h5>4. What is the difference between ohmic resistance and non-ohmic resistance?</h5>
