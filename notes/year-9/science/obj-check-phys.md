  <h2>Where I check if I know the objectives</h2>
  <h3>Structure of the atom & Electrostatics</h3>
  <h4>Define charged particle as a particle with an electric charge eg ion, electron, proton</h4>
  <p>Completed</p>
  <h4>Define the unit of elementary electrical charge as coulomb - 1C ~ 6.24 * 10^18 elementary charges (q) or 1 elementary charge is approx. 1.60 * 10^-19C</h4>
  <p>Needs to be revised</p>
  <h4>Compare and contrast conductors and Insulators</h4>
  <p>Conductors are materials that allow the transfer of energy. They have loosely held charged particles within the lattice. The latice itself is positively charged. These include metals like copper, silver and gold. Superconductors include pure metals and super cold oxides. An insulator retains the energy of another object. Their charged particles cannot be free to move. Insulators include salts and pure water.<br>This needs to be rechecked.</p>
  <h4>Define static electricty</h4>
  <p>Static electricity is the transfer of electrons from one material to another by friction and kinetic energy. When enough kinetic energy is acquired, the material with the stronger positive charge will rip the electrons from the object with weaker positive charge.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Identify how electrical charges are transferred in static electricity</h4>
  <p>Done</p>
  <h3>Current electricity and electrical circuits</h3>
  <h4>Define voltage, electrical current and resistance including their correct units</h4>
  <p>Voltage is the energy used and supplied for the electrons to move, measured in Volts (V). Current is how quickly the electrons move, and this is measured in Amps (A). Resistance is how easily electrons can move through the circuit, measured in Ohms (insert omega symbol).<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Identify electrical circuit symbols</h4>
  <p>Done, but should be revised and drawn</p>
  <h4>Draw electrical circuit diagrams following convention.</h4>
  <p>Will be done</p>
  <h4>Analyse circuit diagrams to wire a circuit correctly</h4>
  <p>Done, just remember to parallel the voltmeter to the resistor</p>
  <h4>Compare and contrast series and parallel circuit and applications of each</h4>
  <p>A series circuit is when all the parts are in one circuit - one line of everything. The energy receivers will receive the (voltage supplied / number of receivers) of V. A parallel circuit is when different energy receivers are in different extentions of the circuit. The voltage each extention is supplies is equivalent to the voltage supplied originally.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Explain the effects of variable resistors in circuits</h4>
  <p>Variable resistors slow down the electron current, and makes it harder for the current to flow. Variable resistors' resistance can be adjusted, and they are ohmic resistors, which means they follow Ohm's law (V = IR)</p>
  <h3>Ohm's law and measuring current, voltage and resistance</h3>
  <h4>Distinguish between measuring current, voltage and resistance.</h4>
  <p>To measure current, put an ammeter in series with the circuit. To measure voltage, but the voltmeter in series with the rest of the circuit. To measure resistance, calculate all the known resistances and add them together.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Follow and algorithm to perform simple calculations using Ohms law (V = IR) for ohmic devices</h4>
  <p>Done</p>
  <h4>Apply the use of ammeters and voltmeters to determine V, I and R for constructed electrical circuits (series and parallel)</h4>
  <p>Done</p>
  <h4>Calculate total resistance for series and parallel circuits</h4>
  <p>Series: Total resistance = R1 + R2 + R3 etc<br>Parallel: (1/RT) = (1/R1) + (1/R2) + (1/R3) etc.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Explain electrical energy loss across a resistor due to transfer of electrical energy to other forms - light, sound, heat, etc</h4>
  <p>Energy can be lost from a resistor in other forms. In a resistor like a lightbulb, energy is lost to light and heat, and the filament heats up and produces light. As the conservation of energy states, energy cannot be created or destroyed. Some of the energy from the circuit was used to create the light. Same goes for things like variable resistors as some of their energy is lost to heat.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Define electrical power and units (watts)</h4>
  <p>The rate that energy is transferred by an electrical circuit. This is measured in watts.<br>Desperately needs revising</p>
  <h4>Follow an algorithm to perform simple calculations using power = energy use/time</h4>
  <p>Oh no we haven't learnt this</p>
  <h4>Follow an algorithm to perform simple calculations using power = current * voltage.</h4>
  <p>Done</p>
  <h3>Wave energy and motion</h3>
  <h4>Explain the way energy is transferred through different mediums</h4>
  <p>Energy is transferred through different mediums by vibrations.<br>Needs revising</p>
  <h4>Define wave motion as a transfer of energy</h4>
  <p>Done</p>
  <h4>Describe wave motion as having no net movement of matter</h4>
  <p>Done</p>
  <h4>Describe how different forms of energy such as heat, electricity, light and sound are transferred</h4>
  <p>Through waves<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Define mechanical waves as those requiring a medium to transpart energy from one location to another.</h4>
  <p>Done</p>
  <h4>Use examples to show how waves energy is used in communication</h4>
  <p>Radio waves are commonly used in communication, and the compression and rarefaction of sound waves is used in verbal communication. Visible light is used in graphical communication.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Descrive a wave using: speed, wavelength, frequency, period and amplitude</h4>
  <p>Transverse waves' speeds are all the same, but their frequency and period differ. The freqency of a wave is how many times a wave repeats within one second, and a period is how long it takes a wave to complete. The amplitude of a wave is the length o the wave from the midpoint to the crest or the trough of the wave. A wavelength is how long the wave is from one point of the wave to the next recurring point.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Compare and contrast transverse waves and longitudinal waves</h4>
  <p>Transverse waves are waves that look like ocean waves. They can be both mechanical (using matter to be created) or electromagnetic (going through matter). Transverse waves include ocean waves, secondary earthquake waves and light waves. Longitudinal waves are waves that don't look like waves. Instead, they are compression and rarefaction of matter (usually air). They are all mechanical waves. Longitudinal waves include sound waves and primary earthquake waves.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Follow and algorithm to perform calculations using the wave equation (V = f * [insert lambda symbol] and T = 1/f), distance = speed * time.</h4>
  <p>Done, just formulas need to be revised.</p>
  <h3>Wave behaviour and the electromagnetic spectrum</h3>
  <h4>Define EM radiation as a transverse wave - no medium required</h4>
  <p>Done</p>
  <h4>Transfer energy via electrical and magnetic disturbances</h4>
  <p>Done</p>
  <h4>Define the speed of light</h4>
  <p>The speed of light is how fast light travels in a vacuum.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Sequence the variation in EM type case on [insert lambda symbol] and frequency (EM spectrum)</h4>
  <p>Gamma rays, x-rays, UV rays, visible light, infrared, microwaves, radio waves.<br>Done, jsut need to remember UV rays</p>
  <h4>Relate the properties of EM to their radiation types</h4>
  <p>Electromagnetic waves have two fields - the electrical field and the magnetic field. These are formed at the same time. This means that EM waves will emit heat and radiation.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Investigate generalised wave properties using experiments with light</h4>
  <p>Done, hopefully</p>
  <h4>Explain how different mediums affect the speed of light</h4>
  <p>Different medium affect the speed of light because light moves between matter. The more matter there is, the longer it takes for light to move through the matter, therefore affecting the speed of light.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Describe the transfer of light through reflection and refraction</h4>
  <p>Light can reflect off surfaces. On a green surface, light will absorb all colours except green. On a white surface, all light will reflect. Light will also reflect off a reflective surface. Light will bend and refract through certain mediums, like water.<br>Done, just needs to be checked</p>
  <h3>Sound waves</h3>
  <h4>Label parts of the eye and recall their function</h4>
  <p>The cornea is the protection of the eye. It bends and refract light into the pupil. The iris is the coloured part of the eye, which contain cilliary muscles. THe cilliary muscles are connected to the pupil, which can change the size of the pupil, depending on the amount of the light exposed to it. The more light, the smaller the pupil. The pupil lets light into the optic lens. The optic lens refract the light. The aqueous humour is the liquid solution between the cornea and the lens. The vireous humour is the liquid inside the eye. The retina is the back of the eye. In the retina, there are rods, which see black, white and shape, and cones, which see colour. There are many more rods than cones. They are called receptors The fovea is a depression in the retina where light ideally refracts and focuses. There are more receptors in the fovea compared to other areas. The optic nerve is where the signals that the receptors receive travel along, and the optic nerve leads to the brain.<br>Done, needs checking</p>
  <h4>Explain how the human eye transfers light to create an image.</h4>
  <p>Light will go through the cornea, which refracts the light. The light then goes through the pupil, which filters the light. The light refracts through the optic lens, and the light ideally focuses into the fovea. The receptors in the retina turns the light waves into signals, which it sends down the optic nerve to the brain.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Define sound waves as longitudianl wave energy transfer</h4>
  <p>Done</p>
  <h4>Describe some applications of echoes</h4>
  <p>Echoes are used by some animals as echolocation. This is the give the animal a sense of where they are and where their prey and predators are.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Follow and algorithm to perform simple calculations for echo sounding sonar and ultrasound</h4>
  <p>Done</p>
  <h4>Compare and contrast the speed of sound in different mediums</h4>
  <p>Done</p>
  <h4>Describe human and animal thresholds (frequency and communication)</h4>
  <p>An average human hearing is from 20hz to 20kHz.<br>Done, not sure we need animal thresholds</p>
  <h4>Relate frequency, wavelength and amplitude of sound waves to pitch and loudness</h4>
  <p>The higher the amplitude of the wave, the louder the sound. The higher the frequency and wavelength, the higher the pitch.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Explain how we produce speech</h4>
  <p>We use our vocal cords to produce speech. When we release one stream of air, there is almost no compression and rarefaction in the air, until it meets outside. When we open and close our vocal cords, we create compression and rarefaction in the air.<br>Done</p>
  <h4>Label a diagram of an ear</h4>
  <p>Needs to be drawn</p>
  <h4>Explain how sound transfers through a human ear</h4>
  <p>The sound is captured in the pinna, and it is channeled towards the ear canal. The sound waves reach the eardrum and the vibrates in response to the waves hitting it. This causes the ossicles, the hammer, anvil and stirrup to move. The ossicles are three small bones in the middle ear. There is an eustachian tube, which helps keep the air pressure on both sides of the ear drum equal. The vibrations are the travelled into the inner ear. The sound reaches the vestible and cochlea, which are filled with fluid and nerve cells. Some vibrations may go through the semicircular tubes, which also contain the nerve cells. The nerve cells send signals down the auditory tube and vestibular tube, which lead into the brain. The brain processes these signals and interprets these as sound.<br>Done</p>
