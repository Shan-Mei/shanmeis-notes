  <h2>Waves</h2>
  <h3>Types of Waves</h3>
  <h4>Transverse waves</h4>
  <p>They look like this: 〰<br>Examples include ocean waves, secondary earthqyake (eq) waves, surface eq waves, light waves. There are two types of transverse waves. These are transverse mechanical and transverse electromagnetic. More on this later. The middle of the transverse wave is called the midpoint, equilibrium or rest position. The crest or peak of the wave is the highest point of the wave, and the trough is the lowest point. The distance between the midpoint to the crest or midpoint to the trough is called amplitude. A wavelength is how long one point of the wave is to the next reoccuring point.</p>
  <h4>Longitudinal waves</h4>
  <p>Don't look like waves. Instead, they are made from refraction and compression of a material, commonly air. Examples include sound and primary eq waves. Longitudinal waves are always mechanical. The wavelength of a longitudinal wave is from one side of the compression to the next recurring compression.</p>
  <h4>Mechanical waves</h4>
  <p>Mechanical waves are waves that include the movement of matter, whether that be solid, liquid or gas. Mechanical waves can be both transverse and longitudinal.</p>
  <h4>Electromagnetic waves</h4>
  <p>Electromagnetic waves travel through a medium. It is similar to light, which some we can see and some we can't. These include visible light, gamma rays, X-rays, UV rays, micro waves and radio waves. Electromagnetic waves are called electromagnetic waves because they form an electrical and magnetic field at the same time. They look like there are two waves on the same midpoint.</p>
  <h3>Measuring waves</h3>
  <h4>Terms</h4>
  <p>Period (T): the time it takes for a wave to complete a wavelength. Measure in seconds.<br>Frequency (f): How many wavelengths a second. Measured in Hertz (Hz).<br>Wavelength: The measurement of how long a wave is, from a point to where the next point reoccurs. Measured in λ</p>
  <h4>Measuring electromagnetic waves</h4>
  <p>The visible spectrum is the band of "colour" that we see. Colour is the measure of electromagnetic wave frequency. Red is the lowest frequency while the highest is purple. White is a combination of all frequencies, and black has no frequency. If you think about it, an object that appears red is anything but red.</p>
  <h4>Equations</h4>
  <p>T = λ/V<br>f = 1/T<br>V = f*λ</p>
  <h3>Light</h3>
  <h4>Types of rays</h4>
  <p>In order: Gamma ray, X-ray, Ultraviolet, Visible, Infrared, Microwave, Radio.</p>
  <h4>Speeds of light in different mediums</h4>
  <p>Per second<br>Vacuum: 186000 miles, Water: 140000 miles, Glass: 124000 miles, Diamond: 77500 miles. Light slows down in denser mediums, as there is more particles to go through, that are blocking the light.</p>
  <h4>Filters</h4>
  <p>Filters are things that only allow certain wavelengths to pass. Pure colour lights are the same as well. If you shone a pure red light on green leaves at night, you would see black. If you put glasses that only allowed red light in, you would just see black leaves in the day time. When, for example, a green and blue filter are stacked, the blue filter will block out the green light when the green light passes. </p>
  <h3>Angle of incidence and reflection</h3>
  <h4>The normal</h4>
  <p>The "control" line between the incident and reflection rays. It runs from the centre of the mirror to 0 angle.</p>
  <h4>Incident ray</h4>
  <p>The incident ray is the light that is shone onto a reflective surface.</p>
  <h4>Reflection ray</h4>
  <p>The reflection ray is the ray that is reflected. The angle is the same as the angle of the incident ray to the normal.</p>
  <h3>Sound</h3>
  <h4>Graphing sound</h4>
  <p>The most compressed sound is the crest, and the most rarefacted is the trough. Think of the original compression and rarefaction as a grain wave - the compressed bits are the top and the rarefacted dipping down. The less compressed the compressed area, the lower the amplitude. The top half of the wave group should be labelled as Compression, and the bottom half as Rarefaction.</p>
  <h4>Speeds of sound</h4>
  <p>In air, it is 343 m/s. In water, it is 1481 m/s. Sound moves the slowest in rubber, and steel is the fastest.</p>
  <h4>Echos</h4>
  <p>V = d/t (distance/time). Velocity is measured in m/s, distance in m and time in s. We should draw a diagram, just in case we get tricked by returning sound waves.
  <h3>Anatomies and how they work</h3>
  <h4>The ear</h4>
  <p>They ear works by sound waves being drawn into the ear. The sound waves go through the ear canal, and they make the ear drums vibrate, causing the three bones, the ossicles to vibrate. The vibrations then go into the vestible and cochlea, which turn the vibrations into nerve signals. Inside the cochlea, there is a fluid, and the vibrations make the water move, which causes the nerve signals inside the cochlea to move. The signals from the cochlea go through the auditory nerve and into the brain. Some vibrations may also be sent to the semicircular canals, and they also have nerve signals, and the signals travel along the vesticular nerve. The brain will decode the signals into sound. The inner ear can also tell balance, and the fluid inside the inner ear will also cause the nerves to move and send signals to the brain about balance.</p>
  <h4>The larynx and lungs</h4>
  <p>When we breathe out, there is no difference in compression and rarefraction of the air, only that there is a difference when the air in our lungs meet the outside. The vocal cords will open and close when we speak or sing. If there is one consistant stream of air (breathing out) there is barely any compression and rarefaction. When vocal cords open and close, it will create the movement in the air.</p>
  <h4>The eyes</h4>
  <p>The eye receives the light through the cornea and the optic lens. The lens then refract the light, which hits the retina. The cones and the rods receive the light and decode the light waves into signals. It goes through the optic nerve and reaches the brain.<br>The cornea protects the eye and bends light into the optic lens. The pupil allows light into the optic lens and can change size depending on how much light there is. The retina is at the back of the eye. It contains rods, that see black, white and shape, and cones, which see colour. The aqueous humour is the solution between the lens and the cornea. The iris is the coloured part of the eye which contain ciliary muscle, which control how large the pupil opening is. The vitreous humour is the solution inside the eye itself. The optic nerve is where the signals will go through when the rods and cones have deciphered the light waves. The macula is where there is a slight depression in the retina, where it is more abundant in rods and cones. In the macula, there is a fovea. For clear vision, the light should focus there.</p>
  <h4>Types of vision</h4>
  <p>Emmetropia: 20/20 vision, perfect vision where the light refracts so the focus point is at the fovea.<br>Myopia: short sightedness, where the light refracts and focuses before the fovea.<br>Hyperopia: long sightedness, where light refracts and focuses past the fovea.<br>Glasses can help us refract light later or earlier.</p>
