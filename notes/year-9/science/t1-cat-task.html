  <h3>Researching and Planning</h3>
  <h4>Hypothesis</h4>If the voltage across an ohmic resistor increases, the current and voltage will proportianally to each other, while if the voltage across a non-ohmic resistor increases, the current and voltage will not increase proportionally to each other.
  <h4>Variables</h4>
  <p>Independant Variable: Voltage of the power supply across ohmic and non-ohmic resistors (V)<br>Dependant variable: The proportionality between current and voltage.<br>Controlled Variables: The resistance of the wires (Ohms), the material of the wire, the length of wires used (m).</p>
  <h4>Research</h4>
  <h5>1. What is Ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>Ohmic resistance is the sum of the resistors, resistance of the current collector, the active mass and the resistance of the wires. Basically, It is the resistance of every part of the circuit combined.</p>
  <h5>2. What is non-Ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>Non-Ohmic resistance is resistance that doesn't follow Ohm's law (V = I/R), such as temperature.</p>
  <h5>3. How can we tell if a material has ohmic or non-ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>ERm<br>When the current and voltage is graphed, the lines are not straight and are not proportianate to one another.</p>
  <h5>4. What is the difference between ohmic resistance and non-ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>Ohmic resistance follows Ohm's law (V = IR), whereas non-Ohmic resistance does not.</p>
  <h5>5. How is the graphing of voltage vs current used to determine ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>When you graph ohmic current and voltage, they will move in similar motion. If one goes diagonally down, the other will also go diagonally down, and vice versa. However, when you graph non-ohmic resistance, the direction and gradiant of the lines will fluctuate.</p>
  <h5>6. List and explain the types of devices which display non ohmic behaviour</h5>
  <p>Filament lamp. The hotter the lamp gets, the more resistance it will gain. This doesn't follow Ohm's law, therefore it is non-ohmic.<br>Diode. Diodes only allow a one-way flow of electrons, and if flown the other way round, electrons are not able to pass. This doesn't follow Ohm's law.<br>Thermistor. The resistance decreases as the temperature increases.<br>Light dependant resistors. The resistance of these decrease as the amount of light shone on them decrease.</p>
  <h3>Final Report Transcript</h3>
  <h5>Aim</h5>
  <p>The aim of this experiment is to test the proportionality between current and voltage in ohmic and non-ohmic resistance.</p>
  <h5>Preliminary Research</h5>
  <p>Ohmic resistance is resistance that follows Ohm's law (V = IR) and non-ohmic resistance is resistance that doesn't follow ohm's law. When graphed, the relationship between voltage and current should be linear in Ohmic resistors, where in non-ohmic resistors, the current and voltage are not always linear to each other. Non-ohmic behaviour can include a fluctuation of resistance in certain conditions. Some examples of non-ohmic resistors include the filament lamp, a thermistor and light dependant resistors. A filament lamp's resistance increases the hotter it gets, and this behaviour does not follow Ohm's law. A thermistor's resistance decreases as the temperature increases and a light dependant resistor's decreases as the intensity of light shone on it increases.</p>
  <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
  <p>If the voltage across an ohmic resistor increases, the current and voltage will proportionally to each other, while if the voltage across a non-ohmic resistor increases, the current and voltage will not increase proportionally to each other.</p>
  <h5>Variables</h5>
  <p>The independent variable is the voltage of the power supply across ohmic and non-ohmic resistors (V).<br>The dependent variable is the relationship between current and voltage in the resistors.<br>Controlled variables include:<br>- The resistance of the wires (Ohms)<br>- The material of wiring<br>- How much wiring is used (m)<br>-The resistance of variable resistor (Ohms)</p>
  <h5>Materials and Equipment</h5>
  <p>1 filament lightbulb<br>5 copper wires<br>1 variable resistor<br>1 energy pack, which can supply 2V<br>1 Ammeter<br>1 Voltmeter</p>
  <h5>Method</h5>
  <p>1.	Set up the circuit so ammeter, variable resistor and power supply are in series with each other. The variable resistor and voltmeter need to be in parallel with each other.<br>2.	Set the power supply to 2V and the variable resistor's resistance to 10 ohms.<br>3.	Turn on the switch on the energy pack and measure the voltage in V and current in A<br>4.	Repeat steps 2 - 3 for 4 Ohms, 6 Ohms and 8 Ohms.<br>5.	Replace the variable resistor with a filament lightbulb and repeat steps 2 - 4.</p>
  <h5>Table of Results</h5><h5>Graphs</h5><h5>Analysis</h5>
  <p>The data in graph 1 and graph 2 show that the variable resistor, an ohmic resistor's voltage and current were linear, and that they went in parallel direction. This supports Ohm's law, V = IR as we can see that the current times the resistance is equal to the voltage. However, as displayed in the data, the lightbulb, a non-ohmic resistor's current and voltage were not directly proportional to each other. This does not support Ohm's law. For both resistors, as the volts supplied increased, the current and voltage increased.</p>
  <h5>Conclusion</h5>
  <p>In the experiment testing the proportionality between current and voltage in ohmic and non-ohmic resistors, we see that when the volts supplied to the ohmic resistor (variable resistor) was 2V, the current was 0.1A and the voltage was 1.1V. When the volts supplied to the non-ohmic resistor (lightbulb) was 2V, the current was 0.1A and the voltage as 1V. However, when the ohmic resistor's supplied volts increased to 4V and 6V, the current was 0.19A and 0.28A, and the voltage was 2.04A and 2.99A respectively. When the non-ohmic resistor's supplied volts were increased to 4V and 6V, the current was 0.15A and 0.2A, and the voltage was 2.17V and 3.44V. Therefore, the hypothesis that the current and voltage would be proportional to each other in the variable resistor and the current and voltage would not be proportional in the lightbulb is supported.</p>
  <h5>Dicussion</h5>
  <p>This data is expected data as the preliminary study sources informed us that ohmic resistors follows Ohm's law while non-ohmic resistors did not. We know that the filament in a filament lightbulb increases its resistance as it heats up, and that the variable resistor's resistance doesn't change unless it is manually increased or decreased. This experiment is not very reliable as results were only recorded once - there was no average to each result. However, this experiment has been repeated by others such as the Florida University, and the results are very similar. This experiment also is only mildly valid, as the scope of experiment is large. The difference between the highest voltage supplied and the lowest supplied voltage is 6, and this isn't a large range. However, this data scope is wide enough that we can still create further hypotheses in regards to the aim and the data. The set of collected data does not include any clear outliers - all the data is uniform on the graph.</p>
