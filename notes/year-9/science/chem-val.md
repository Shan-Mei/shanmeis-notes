## Chemistry Validation Notes
#### Neutralisation
Acid + Base reaction  
Acid + Base -> Salt + Water (+ CO<sub>2</sub>)  
Strong acids
- HCl
- HNO<sub>3</sub>
- HSO<sub>4</sub>

Weak acids
- CH<sub>3</sub>COOH
- H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
- H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>

Acids are aqueous
- Strong acids exist in the form of H<sup>+</sup> and \[something]<sup>-</sup>
- Weak acids are a combination of split form and full form

Strong bases
- Group 1 or 2 metals
	- In hydroxide or oxide forms

Weak bases
- NH<sub>3</sub>
- NH<sub>4</sub>OH
- NaHCO<sub>3</sub>

Other forms of neutralisation
- Acid + metal oxide -> salt + water
- Acid + metal hydroxide -> salt + water
- Acid + metal carbonate -> salt + water + carbon dioxide
- Acid + metal hydrogen carbonate -> salt + water + carbon dioxide

#### Combustion
Exothermic reactions (heat produced)  
Fuel are hydrocarbons
- Hydrogen + carbon
- Alkanes, alkenes, alkines, cyclo, alcohol are types of hydrocarbons
- Also sometimes include oxygen

Types of combustion reactions
- Metal + oxygen -> metal oxide
	- Rusting
- Fuel + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water

#### Precipitation
A solid from 2 solutions
- Stronger attraction between anion and cation than to water
- Complicated displacement

#### Observations
MARKED!!!  
In year 9, all solutions are done to completion + done correctly
- Theory
