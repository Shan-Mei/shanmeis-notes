  <h2>Notes on Electricity</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <h4>Coulomb's Law</h4>
  <p>Coulomb's law is that like charges repel and unlike charges attract. They have the same overall charge. Protons and electons attract, while their same kind repel. They have an attraction rate, and electrons can move around because of this. In shells, protons and electrons attract each other, and that's what keeps the atom together.</p>
  <h4>Coulombs (measurement)</h4>
  <p>A coulomb is a measure of electrical force. It requires <var>6.24*10^18</var> protons or electrons to equal a coulomb.</p>
  <h4>Ionisation</h4>
  <p>The act of becoming an ion.</p>
  <h3>Static Electricity</h3>
  <h4>Insulators</h4>
  <p>Insulators are materials that don't conduct electricity well. I will expand on this later.</p>
  <h4>Static Charge and Discharge</h4>
  <p>The theory of static electricity has been written for over 2000 years. These deal with insulators. <br>When two things rub against each other, they both become charged (one positive, one negative). When they are rubbed, they transfer and lose electrons. This is because of the pull from the protons - the object with higher positive charge will attract electrons and the one with weaker positive charge will get the electrons ripped from them. Literally like an irl relationship. When you slap the charged object onto something else that is oppositely charged, it will stick to it. That's why hair and balloon stick when you rub them. This charge is created by kinetic energy. Eventually, the extra charge will disperse and the material will either gain back its electrons or transfer their electrons to air. This process is called static discharge.</p>
  <h4>Lightning</h4>
  <p>Lightning is based off static charge and kinetic energy. When water molecules bump in the sky, they will charge each other. Within the cloud, the positive charges will float to the top and the negative to the bottom of the cloud. And when there is enough kinetic energy a very large spark will be created.</p>
  <h4>Grounding</h4>
  <p>Literally connect a non-reactice object to the ground. Preferably earth, carpet will probably not work. If you don't ground and the static charge keeps building and building there will be a spark created. I literally screamed when I put the metal ball at the Vann de Graaf.</p>
  <h3>Circuits</h3>
  <h4>Batteries</h4>
  <p>┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓<br>|- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -|<br>|- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -|<br>|━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━|<br>|  + + + + + + + + + + + +  |<br>|  + + + + + + + + + + + +  |<br>┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛<br>This is a battery. But very funny looking. Some stuff isn't aligned. Stupid thing...<br>Aside from that, one side of the battery is negatively charged, one side is positively charged. The negatively charged half is full of electrons. The positively charged side is full of protons that don't have electrons attached to them. They really want the electrons in the other half. This is called potential diffence. A classmate pointed out this was just like two lovers yearning for each other (there's this classmate where the relationships analogies are coming from). However, when the two sides of the battery are insulated from one another, the reaction cannot occur. When a wire is wired between them, the reaction occurs, and when all the electrons are with the protons, the reaction is finished, and the battery is "flat." <br>The potential difference is called voltage (V).<br>1 coulomb per second is an Amp (A).</p>
  <h4>Circuits</h4>
  <p>A circuit must be closed for the electrons to flow around. The flow of electrons is called current (I). When there is a gap in circuitry, there needs a large potential difference for the electrons to make the jump. There also needs some sort of power station, like a battery or generator. To make the current useful, it needs to flow through different components, like filament for a lightbulb. </p>
  <h4>Old theories</h4>
  <p>Convential current ≠ normal current. Convential current was the theory that positive charges flowed to the negative charges.<p>
  <h4>Resistance</h4>
  <p>Resistance is how easily electrons can flow through the circuit. The lower the resistance, less voltage and energy is used to transfer the electrons, whereas if the resistance is higher, the higher the voltage needs to be. Voltage and resistance are directly proportionate to one another and resistance is measure in Ohms (Ω).</p>
  <h4>Types of Circuits</h4>
  <p>Series circuits: Where everything is connected by one circuit. To work out the voltage across each receiver, divide the voltage supplied with the number of receivers.<br>Parralel circuits: Where it is like two circuits joined together. Each receiver receives the amount of voltage supplied by the power supply.<br>Combination circuits: has some stuff in series and some stuff in parralel. We use this when using a voltmeter. Each extention receives the amount of voltage supplied, and the calculate the amount of voltage receivers in parralel receive, divide the voltage in the extention by the number of receivers.</p>
  <h4>Ohm's Law</h4>
  <p>When the voltage increases, the current increases. When the resistance increases, the voltage increases. Think of it as a class trying to get through a door with linked arms. How wide the door is open is the resistance, how much effort we use to get out of the door is voltage, how fast we get through the door is current. If the door is wide open, we can effortlessly run out of the class. The resistance is low, the voltage is low and the current is high. Now the door is only just wide enough so we can squeeze through it.We use a lot more energy and we get out the door a lot slower. The voltage and resistance is high, and the current is low. Credits to Mr Mort for the analogy. Current is directly proportional to voltage. Current is inversely proportional to resistance. This creates the equation: V = IR</p>
  <h4>Resistance Calculations</h4>
  <p>Series: Add all the resistances together.<br>Parralel: 1/Total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 etc.<br>Combination: Calculate the series first, then the parralel.</p>
