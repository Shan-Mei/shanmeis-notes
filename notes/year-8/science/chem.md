## Year 8 Chemistry

#### Groups and Charges
Alkali metals: 1+  
Alkali earth metals: 2+  
Halogens: 1-  
Noble gases: nothing  
Group 16 (oxygen, sulphur): 2-  
Group 15 (nitrogen, phosphorous): 3-  
Group 13 (aluminum): 3+  

#### Terms and Basics
Reading the periodic table  
<img src="https://shanmeis-notes.toomwn.xyz/assets/science/reading-periodic-table.jpeg">  
<br>
Atomic number is number of protons in the element  
Number of neutrons determined by atomic weight minus atomic number  
Number of electrons is atomic number subtract charge<br><br> 
Key terminology:  
- Element (both plural and singular): One or more atoms that has a specific number of protons. A substance will be considered an element if all the element has the same number of protons. The number of electrons and neutrons don't affect definition
- Isotopes: the number of neutrons in an element. An element has isotopes if same type of atom has different neutrons. Electrons doesn't effect.
- Ion: different number of electrons cause an ion of an element. This causes charges. Atoms always ant to have full shells. An ion is an element with a charge other than 0

#### Hydrogen
Weird
- Only 1 to gain or lose for full shells
	- Since for full shells need 2 electrons
	- Sometimes acts like halogen, sometimes metal
	- Sometimes gets placed in different places of periodic table

Hydrogen peroxide vs water
- Hydrogen peroxide is 2 hydrogen 2 water
	- Can remember with "pair oxide"
- Water is 2 hydrogen 1 water

#### CH₃COOH
Not written in molecular formula
- Bonded by atom weight

- Bonded differently
- Can be written as C₂H₄O₂

#### Coulomb's Law
Like charges repel, unlike attract  
Particles with same overall charge will repel and vice versa
- Like bar magnets
- Electrons negatively charged
- Protons positively charged
- They attract
- Electrons travel too fast to react
- Protons and protons want to push away
	- Neutrons stop protons from escaping and act like glue
- Electrons also want to repel
	- Spread out
	- Inner and outer shells work the same way

#### Calculating ions

Beryllium neutral
- Protons: 4
- Neutrons: 5
- Electrons: 4
- Possible ions
	- 1 shell (2): 4 - 2 = 2+
	- 2 shells (2 + 8): 4 - 10 = 6-
- Realistic ions
	- 1 shell: 2+

Carbon
- Needs +4 for 2 shells
- Needs -4 for 1 shell
- Does neither and just shares electrons with other atoms
- Sometimes acts differently

#### Completing Valence Shells
Stealing electrons from other atoms
<img src="https://shanmeis-notes.toomwn.xyz/assets/science/ionic-bonding.jpeg">
- They want to attract each other
	- Form compounds
	- When naming, positive charged atom goes first

#### Compounds
When trying to get full valence shells (the outermost shell with electrons), we need to consider naming them and how they bond  
Anion = negatively charged elements  
Cation = positively charged elements<br><br>
Metal + non-metal
- Metals become cations
- Non-metals become anions
- Called ionic bonds

Non-metal + non-metal
- Share, or have an infinite electron claiming fight
- Called covalent bonds

Metal + metal
- Called alloys
- Electrons are shared in a metallic lattice

#### Naming ionic bonds
1. Keep cation's name and use it first
	- Lithium stays lithium
2. Anion loses suffix and gains the -ide suffix
	- Nitrogen -> nitride
	- Oxygen -> oxide
	- Sulphur -> sulphide
- Eg
	- Potassium nitride
	- Lithium sulfide

#### Naming covalent molecules
1. Use the name that is most metal (closest to bottom left)
	- Keep element name
2. Name other element like how we usually name anions
3. Use greek prefixes
	- Don't use on the first element if it is only 1 of the element

#### Mixing compounds
Magnesium<sup>2+</sup> chloride<sup>-</sup> + Sodium<sup>+</sup> hydroxide<sup>-</sup>
- MgCl₂ + NaOH -> Mg(OH)₂ + NaCl
- MgCl₂ + 2NaOH -> Mg(OH)₂ + 2NaCl

Ammonium<sup>+</sup> oxide<sup>2-</sup> + Magnesium<sup>2+</sup> carbonate<sup>2-</sup>
- (NH₄)₂O + MgCO₃ -> (NH₄)₂CO₃ + MgO

#### Catalysts
As substance you can put in to speed up a reaction
- Reduces energy used
- Faster reactions
- Lower required temperature
- Increased rate of reaction without catalyst being used up
	- Reusable
- Never increase the amount of products
- Catalysis reduces need for energy to the minimum
- Environmentally friendly

Enthalpy (H)
- Measure of potential energy
	- Can't be measured directly
- Enthalpy in reactant and product isn't the same
- Temperature = average kinetic energy of a substance
- Enthalpy change measured as temperature changes

Exothermic reaction - Ex (out) - 'exit'
- Release energy from system to surroundings
- Temperatures of surroundings increase -> get hot

Endothermic reaction - En (in) - 'entrance'
- Absorb energy
