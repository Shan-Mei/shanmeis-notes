title: Year 8 Physics

## Physics Notes
They are very minimal as I didn't take many notes... no wonder why I only scored a 70 in year 8 physics...  

#### Forces

#### GUESS
**G**iven  
**U**nknown  
**E**quation  
**S**ubstitution  
**S**olve (units)  

#### Sankey diagrams
Representation of where energy goes in a closed system

Energy efficiency calculations  
a (useful energy) = 6  
b (input energy) = 10  
<br>
Write out formula, complete calculations.<br><br>Efficiency = $$\frac{a}{b} \times 100$$ (to get the percentage)  
Efficiency = $$\frac{6}{10} \times 100 = 60\%$$<br><br>Energy transfers + transformats can result in useful energy, desired energy, and wasted energy.  
Eg.  
A lightbulb transforms 100J electrical energy to 25J light energy and 75J heat energy.  
Useful: 25J light energy
Wasted: 75J heat energy<br><br>You can treat efficiency like a test score.<br><br>km/hr -> m/s  
1000m per km  
3600 sec per hr  
1000m/3600s<br><br>60km/h -> 16.6m/s  
(km/h $$\div$$ 3.6)
