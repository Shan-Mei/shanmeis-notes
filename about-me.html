  <p>I upload my school and assessment notes into this website, and I rant about random things. I also upload what I did for assessments, after the due date. I have a couple random funny things floating around the site. I am also a big fan of the ocean and cherry blossoms. That's why the website is blue and pink.</p>

  <h3>More About Music</h3>
  <p>I like western art music a lot. I hate pop - It's so boring. I like jazz but I don't love it. I don't mind rock. I find world music interesting, and I'm a fan of ghibli scores.<br>I am obsessed with Debussy, and I do not like Shostakovich. There you go Luvenia and Finn, I said it to the world.<br>I play piano to an Amus (aka diploma or grade 10) standard, I play violin through the school program and I just started oboe. I sing and I play descant recorder for leisure. I should be buying myself a fife a little later. I also know how to play horizontal bamboo flute, drumkit, mallet instruments, some auxillary instruments, guzheng and harmonica, all to a very low standard.<br>I do a lot of compositional work. Finished 2 works (That I did willingly, which excludes school assignments) - one oboe solo piece (2022) and a single movement piano concerto (2023). At the moment, I'm working on a piano collection called "13 Haikus," an arrangement of "Aimons nous et Dormons" for SATB, the "Morning" movement of a collaborative symphony and "Meadows" for unconventional chamber ensemble.<br>I have perfect pitch. Just finished training octaves. Current goal is training hertz recognition.<br>Current ensemble count: 8</p>
