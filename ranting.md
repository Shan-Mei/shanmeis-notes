## About Rants
This is literally where I rant about random things, or talk about random things. Please don't take anything here too seriously :)

### Contents
They are divided into complete, ongoing and incomplete, and are listed in order of writing. I also have a collection of my pieces and news articles I write as part of the news reporters of the town.
