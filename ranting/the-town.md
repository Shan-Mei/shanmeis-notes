  <h2>The "Town"</h2>
  <p>In reference to <a href="https://spicata.github.io/theTown.html">Spicata</a> and <a href="https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.3/04-03-2023-The-town-analogy/">Edward</a>'s "articles."</p>
  <h4>How I ended up here</h4>
  <p>You may have heard about the year 11 notes coalition. No I'm a year 9 not a year 11 if that's what you're wondering. I am an individual entity. Kind of.</p>
  <p>You may have heard that I used to use Wix.com. This is true. Funnily enough, that site is still open, but I am not going to link to it. Haha. I used to live in a very large city with my friend <a href="https://beatricesychong.wixsite.com/notes">Beatrice</a>, and other people. It was quite a very very big city, and there wasn't much space. This is why the houses are so small. Hey Edward! I promise my house wasn't gothic themed. It was a very nice house themed with books and plants.<br>Soon enough, I had so many notes that I didn't have enough space to store all the notes. So I left the city. I still kept my diaries with me, and I was homeless for a little while.<br>Edward had been inviting me to join this town for a while, and after a few "reminders," I finally set up... but using a quartz template. I decided to move from this as well, as the house was too "tall and skinny." I didn't like so many stories so I broke down all the foundations I already had and built a phatter house that was a little more stable.</p>
  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>Basically, we live in the middle of the desert. The desert (school) is the home of many disasters. These include zephyrs (homework),strong gusts of wind (tests, assignments and assessments) and sandstorms (academic exams, which luckily, I do not have. Yet.)<br>There are nomads, who are people who wander in the harsh conditions of the desert, and they get by in their own way. Sometimes they come and we provide some of their much needed resources, sometimes they get their resources from the city, which is further north.<br>It is really quite great here, it is nice living in a group of perhaps like-minded residents.</p>
  <h4>The Community</h4>
  <p>I will draw up the community one day and put it here.</p>
  <p>We are a fairly small community, yet we are flourishing. There are water spring and trees.There are small stalls set up, and a few houses. Some of our houses are still foundations (like mine) and some are fairly well developed houses, like Spicata and Edward's.</p>
  <p>Spicata is one of the most important members of the town. Everyone(?) likes him and he is very helpful and kind. He has a house, a garden, and his own stall. He doesn't sell, instead gives away the stuff he collects from his journey through the desert (souvenirs of sorts). This is his <a href="https://spicata.github.io/mint-fresh-notes/">garden </a>and this is his <a href="https://spicata.github.io/">stall</a>. He lives near the square.</p>
  <p>Edward is also an important member of the town, his house design being the inspiration of many others' (more on this later). He "sells" tea and spaghetti. He has a relatively large house, and I myself in particular visit him a lot. I have been accused of dating him many a time because of this, I promise, I am not, I am a year 9 and he is year 11. It just doesn't work. I only visit him because his house is resourceful and that he is very willing to help me with my house. Hmph.<br>His house is around the corner of Spicata's residence, right <a href="https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.3/">here</a>, still next to the town square. I will not talk about how he has burnt down his house twice...</p>
  <p>Mace is also an important member of the town (at this point I'm just going to say everyone is important...). I don't visit him very much, because I do not know him very well. He also sets up a stall of souvenirs, but he allows us to steal them. He lives on a hill a little further from the town square, and his house is fairly large. It is <a href="https://macesnotes.netlify.app/">here</a>.</p>
  <p>I will talk about Notmario but not now.</p>
  <p>Anon is (also) an important member of the town. He has a large interest in science, and his house is full of science experiment tables and sciency textbooks. He offers some very good science insight if you go to his house, and is very smart. He lives behind Spicata, Edward, Mace and Notmario. It is <a href="https://pale-ladybug-133.notion.site/Nuclei-moment-2c89b8b95cc74fd6bab60300753d48e8">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Thomas is a new but important member of the town. He lives next to Edward, and even though he is fairly new, his house is quite developed and I personally really love the design - Its simplicity and its colour scheme and ideas. I have yet to talk to him, and I don't visit his house, but the house is very pretty from the exterior. He also "sells" souvenirs, but I am particularly interested in his souvernirs from Japan. His house is <a href="https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/">here</a>.</p>
  <p>MQ-9 Reaper (who we call Reaper) is also a new but important member of the town. He also lives next to Edward, and his house looks almost identical to Edward's... just smaller. They really do not like each other, but it's not my business, so I will not talk about this any more. He was like me, he also moved from a different city/town... and doens't seem all that happy in this new town. But I admire his willingness to continue trying. His house is <a href="https://grim4reaper.github.io/Year11Notes/">here</a>.</p>
  <p>The last (but not least) member of the town is Jonathan, also a new and important member. He seems like a nice person, but I haven't actually spoken to or visited him very much, if at all... anyways. Like me, he is still settling in. He used to have all his belongings in bags (paper notes) and is now sorting them and putting them in his house. It's still very scaffolded, like my own house. His house still looks like Edward's house, only smaller (just like Reaper's). It is very near to mine. It is <a href="https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/">here</a>.</p>
  <p>This is all the people in the city for now. Hopefully more settlers come in (I long for the day another female identifying person joins...)</p>
