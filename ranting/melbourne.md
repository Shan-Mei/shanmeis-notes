<h2 style="text-align: center;">Melbourne</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Soft, white cumulous clouds,<br>Where delicate whisps of cloud resemble<br>Thin strips of cotton candy,<br>The pure white centres,<br>Encasing the plane with moisture. <br><br>On the other side of the fluffy layer,<br>Rolling hills stretching for <br>Miles and miles, <br>Of little angular patches<br>In varing shades of green.<br><br>Occasionally there's a tree,<br>
Or a cute, traditional cottage, <br>Or a little winding dirt road, <br>Paving through the perfectly green<br>Evenly cut grass. <br><br>The blessed meadows stretch forever<br> Under the jewel blue sky,<br>Where golden winter sunlight<br>Peeks through the white clouds <br>And into the countryside.</p>
