Desolate land
Charred, broken bodies writhing in the aftermath of the war.
Death looms overhead
And the shattered hope continues
     Shattering

Into the black hole
                        Where dark dark memories
                              arise
                               and
Of black                        and fury

From a curse forever set in the land
A war neverending
A fire everburning

                in the air.
