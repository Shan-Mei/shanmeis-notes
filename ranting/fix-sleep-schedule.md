## Fixing your Sleep Schedule!
Often, my friends would message me at around 1 am complaining about not being able to sleep... You know who you are if you're reading this. I get asked a couple times on how to fix this.

#### 1. Measure the number of hours you need to sleep and the number of hours you usually sleep
Sleep when you're tired and wake up when you want for 4 days in a row. We will call these trial days. For the 3rd and 4th day, record the number of hours you spend asleep (roughly) on both those days. Find the average of these two numbers. I assume you already know how many hours you usually sleep. For me, I naturally sleep 11 hours and I usually sleep 7 hours.

#### 2. Take note of what times you sleep and wake up on the "trial" days and your "normal" days
I usually sleep at 10:30 - 11 and wake up roughly around 6 on school days and Saturdays. On the trial days, I slept at 11 and woke up at 10. I am going to assume you have a lot of free days ahead of you. 

#### 3. Starting the reversal process
Since I ended up sleeping 11 hours, for the first day after the trial days (we will call these action days), I will sleep 11 hours. However, I am going to sleep at 10:30 (my usual sleeping time) and wake up at 9:30. For the second action day, I will sleep at 10:15 and wake up at 9:00.

#### 4. Continuing
What I do is I continue sleeping 15 minutes earlier each day and waking up 30 minutes earlier until I reach my desired number of hours I want to sleep a day (9). I will also continue the times outside the framework I stated earlier, until I got to sleeping at 9 and waking at 6. You can change the original ratio and increment if you want, just make sure you do it steadily and not too soon.

#### Note
This is what worked for me, It might not work for you. It's not my fault if it doens't work.
