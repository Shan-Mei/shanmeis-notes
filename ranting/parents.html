  <h2>The Greed and Hypocracy of Some Parents</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Many a time, I've had friends go up to me with their 90% test scores going "MY PARENTS ARE GOING TO KILL ME." and I reply "Oh well good luck." I will try explain the logic behind some parental choices like this.</h4>
  <h3>Scenarios that show your parents love you</h3>
  <h4>Your parents worry about your grades</h4>
  <p>In this scenario, it is pretty clear that your parents love you. They worry about your grades because they care about your future (and perhaps they also want to flex you. But to flex you they gotta love what they're flexing... right?).</p>
  <h5>The above and they allow you to date (before 18 years old)</h5>
  <p>They care about your future but don't worry about your social skills. They normally do this if they believe that their children should receive some bgr (boy-girl relationship) exposure before you're mature enough. Or, they believe that you can make good dating choices and they believe that in youth you can have the bgr exposure.</p>
  <h5>They allow you to dress how you want</h5>
  <p>Your parents believe that their children should follow their own identity and they don't want to make an awful impact on the very choice-based identity of your life (what you like, how you dress, etc).</p>
  <h5>They allow you to have quite a bit of social media</h5>
  <p>Social media counts as facebook, insta, snapchat, whatsapp, discord, xiaohongshu, tiktok, all the other stuff thats not necessary for school. No social media counts as just having messenger/imessage, or not even that. A little bit of social media is not heavy use for 3 or less platforms (excluding default messenger). A medium amount is a heavy use of 3 or less platforms or up to 5 platforms. A lot is a heavy use of 4 - 5 platforms or owning 6+ accounts. So, this is for medium+ use. This is because parents want you to have a social life at a young age and do not worry about how you communicate with other people.</p>
  <h5>You are allowed to pursue hobbies/sports</h5>
  <p>Parents believe that you should pursue your interests.</p>
  <h5>They don't allow you to date before 18 years, but will after</h5>
  <p>They don't believe you are mature enough to make good dating decisions until you are 18, and they want you to focus on your high school grades. I believe that this is a good decision, as we are actually not mature enough, and we don't have enough teaching and exposure to make such decisions.</p>
  <h5>You have to cover most of your skin</h5>
  <p>They believe that you should wear modestly at a young age, especially for the fear of youth predators. They generally are also quite conservative. Or, they just don't think that crop tops and singlets look good.</p>
  <h5>They allow you to have minimal social media, but allow you a phone</h5>
  <p>Generally this happens because your parents don't want you to addicted and don't trust you very much (which they shouldn't). Since addiction isn't good and not easy to fix, they don't want you to go through the pain of removing addiction from yourself. Generally, they want you to have a phone so you can call them after school, etc, or want you to get used to being in possession of a phone.</p>
  <h5>You are forced to do enrichment and sports</h5>
  <p>Well aren't you one stubborn youth. They generally do this, so it will be easier when finding a job, they don't want you to become unfit when you're older (sports), and they want you to do recreational things.</p>
  <h5>They are kinda forcing you to stay single</h5>
  <p>Here is where we get to the controlling kind of love, the wrong type of parent-child love. They are forcing you to stay single because they believe that you belong to them and them only, and they want to keep you safe and theirs forever. They also generally are looking into their future and thinking "wow we'll be quite a the lonely couple without our children." However, they are a bit of hypocrite because they are apparently caring about their child's future through grades?</p>
  <h5>You have to dress the way they want you to dress</h5>
  <p>You are kinda being objectified here I'm so sorry... but generally they do this is because they want you to look good the way other adults will "definitely" think you look good.</p>
  <h5>No phone, no social media</h5>
  <p>They want to give you absolutely no chance at becoming addicted to social media. They are also quite conservative and believe that children should play physically with other children, or they want to really secure your future by not letting you be distracted by other things, and so you can study properly and get good grades.</p>
  <h5>You're not allowed to do enrichment and sports</h5>
  <p>I'm very sorry if you are this person, but your parents believe that your youth years should be study and study only. Like the no phone, no social media, they really want to secure your uni entries.</p>
  <h4>They believe your grades are good enough (when you don't think they are)</h4>
  <p>Generally, this is because they put your health and life experience before your grades, as like my parents, they do not believe that grades give you the essential life skills, like cooking and cleaning, for example. They also generally make you sleep a lot, because they believe your health comes first.</p>
  <h5>You can have medium+ social media</h5>
  <p>Generally because they believe that EQ is more important than IQ.</p>
  <h5>You can have minimal social media</h5>
  <p>They believe socialising is important, but they also don't want you to get addicted, or be victims to online crimes.</p>
  <h5>No socials, no phone</h5>
  <p>They believe that online socialising is not near quality as ftf socialising. They also don't want you to destroy your eye health.</p>
  <h5>No enrichment or sport</h5>
  <p>Well I'm sorry, I can't offer an explanation. It's just too hypocritical.</p>
  <h5>You are doing or are forced into doing enrichment activities</h5>
  <h5>They plan your future out</h5>
  <p>Generally because they know the certain skills you need from the certain things they want you to do. It usually ties into allowing you to do enrichment or them forcing you to do enrichment stuff.</p>
  <h5>They don't plan/they only give a little outline of your future</h5>
  <p>They believe that using the enrichment activities that you do, and the life skills that you learn, you will live well.</p>
  <h4>They just don't care about your grades, and you don't care either</h4>
  <p>They believe that youth is about fun, and they believe that as long as you have the enrichment skills, you can do whatever you want. Generally, only families that know their children won't want to do uni have this happen.</p>
  <h3>When your parents DONT love you</h3>
  <h4>When they don't feed you</h4>
  <p>Well it's a pretty clear sign isn't it... However, only two out of three options exist to be sure they don't love you.</p>
  <h5>Your parents are eating but you aren't and you're not an only child</h5>
  <p>It looks like they don't love you. But trust me, 2/3 times, they kind of do. They're just being too logical about it. Generally, they do this because they believe their children are decently tough. That they can survive with minimal eating. They also believes that it is more beneficial for the remaining children that one of them dies rather than all of them. I will use the bus crash example. You are with your three young children, and a truck is about to rush past. Two of the kids stay put but one kid doesn't see and crosses the road, perpendicular to the truck. Well, instincts are that you're gonna jump and try save them. Well, if you do that, all your kids are probably gonna die because they got no you and your partner doesn't know what they heck happened. So you're most likely all gonna die because you and your kid has died and your other kids died because they can't take care of themselves. Well, it's a type of love too logical to be the intense kind of love that parents assumable feel for their kids.</p>
  <h5>They don't feed you and you're an only child</h5>
  <p>They just don't love you.</p>
  <h5>They don't feed you but your other siblings are allowed to eat</h5>
  <p>Favouritism at its most painful. My condolences if this is you.</p>
