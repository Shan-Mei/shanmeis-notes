## Here for Evermore
Verse 1:  
You loved the world, you loved your creation,  
You loved your confused and mislead nation,  
You sent Jesus as a sacrifice,  
To die for us and pay our price,  
And save us all.<br><br>
Verse 2:  
For me, your effort didn't slide,  
To bring me back to your side,  
I was just like a sad, lost lamb.  
You lifted me up to who I am,  
So I sing you this song.<br><br>
Pre-chorus:  
When the sun rises, when night falls,  
For you today, I strike this chord,  
Your faith is greater than the world,  
Nothing compares to you, Lord!<br><br>
Chorus:  
Should I stumble, should I slip,  
Should I fall in the night,  
If I do, come fill my heart,  
With your love, my guiding light.  
I rise up in your name,  
Your faithfulness at my core,  
Your love could not be greater.  
My God is here for evermore.<br><br>
Verse 3:  
Like a shepherd, you love us all,  
With his crook, to us you call,  
You're slow to anger, quick to forgive,  
And in your mercy, we can live,  
In your steadfast love.<br><br>
Tag x4:  
Like floods and fires, crashing through these walls,  
Your mighty love, your everlasting love  
Like floods and fires, crashing through these walls,  
Your mighty love, your everlasting love<br><br>
Pre-chorus:  
When the sun rises, when night falls,  
For you today, I strike this chord,  
Your faith is greater than the world,  
Nothing compares to you, Lord!<br><br>
Chorus x2:  
Should I stumble, should I slip,  
Should I fall in the night,  
If I do, come fill my heart,  
God, your love, my guiding light .  
I rise up in your name,  
Your faithfulness at my core,  
Your love could not be greater.  
My God is here for evermore.<br><br>
Coda:  
Your love could not be greater,  
Your love will never falter,  
Your love could not be greater,  
My God is here for evermore!
