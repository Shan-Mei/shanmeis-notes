  <h2>The "Lazy Susan" Technique</h2>
  <p>The Lazy Susan technique is a study-practice technique that my violin teacher and conductor taught me. It's kinda like the Pomodoro technique but better :D</p>
  <p>He introduced this technique first in a year 7 class, where he found out (within 5 lessons) that no one in my class ever practised. Unfortunately, this included me.</p>
  <p>The Lazy Susan (which I will refer to as LS) is that round spinny thing on big round tables in fancy asian restaurants. This is where it came from. The purpose of the LS is the take a bit of this and take a bit of that. That's where the technique came from. You take a little study and take a little practice.</p>
  <p>Mr Barclay kept telling me and my class about this technique, until this year (we've had 2 lessons now) and he has never talked about it since this year. Obviously he has picked up on the fact that I now practice.</p>
  <p>And this is how I did it in my busy schedules.</p>
  <p>Mr Barclay would say "surely you can fit in 5 minutes of practice while you study, if 5 minutes makes a difference to your mark then I am seriously concerned." The technique is where you split your study session in half (or in chunks. I do chunks but this is how you fit 5 minutes of practice in), and as a "break" you practice for 5 minutes. And when you practice, don't run through a piece, but run through a small section where you really really need to practice.</p>
  <p>I use an adopted method to this, where I have 20 minutes of study and 5 minutes of instrument. Playing both oboe and violin, I find this very helpful. I study for 20 minutes and I practice for 5 minutes, and I keep doing this until I finish studying.</p>
  <p>It's really worth a try, I recommend it :)</p>
