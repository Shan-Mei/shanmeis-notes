## Letter to you

If comes a time where you leave me alone,  
Maybe because of how apart we've grown,  
And as days pass, our lives continue,  
It hurts to remember the times with you.<br><br>
Under the sunlight, we'd waste the day away,  
Away from the real world our hearts did stray,  
And with you, I could open my heart,  
Under your gaze, my worries depart.<br><br>
When night falls, I'll sit in the moonlight,  
Thinking of how you used to put things so right,  
When dawn breaks, I'll be waiting for you here,  
Speakn't I am when I wipe my tears,<br><br>
I'll love you for as long as the wind blows,  
*And when you stop loving me, I hope I'll know.*
