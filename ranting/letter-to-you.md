  <h2 class="poem">Letter to you</h2>
  <p class="poem">If comes a time where you leave me alone,<br>Maybe because of how apart we've grown,<br>And as days pass, our lives continue,<br>It hurts to remember the times with you.<br><br>Under the sunlight, we'd waste the day away,<br>Away from the real world our hearts did stray,<br>And with you, I could open my heart,  <br>Under your gaze, my worries depart.<br><br>When night falls, I'll sit in the moonlight,<br>Thinking of how you used to put things so right,<br>When dawn breaks, I'll be waiting for you here,<br>Speakn't I am when I wipe my tears,<br><br>I'll love you for as long as the wind blows,<br><i>And when you stop loving me, I hope I'll know.</i></p>
