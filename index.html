  <h1>Shan-Mei's Notes</h1>
  <p><strong>Hi, I'm <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/about-me.html">Shan-Mei</a>.</strong></p>
  <p>I publish my class notes! This is a collection of the notes that I've bothered to type up or scan. Not all of them are good, nor are all of them useful, but I hope you can take something out of them! I'm very passionate about everyone achieving the best they can in the stuff they like in school. Let's push up the average guys!! It would be nice to be scaled up in stuff. </p>
  <p>Here are my <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/notes.html">notes.</a> These notes will hopefully cover a range of subjects, from our cores to extracurriculars like music.</p>
  <p>I also like to keep a <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/journalling.html">journal</a> of my day's happenings and I also like to aimlessly <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/ranting.html">rant</a> about things.</p>
  <p>I also do a lot of <a href="https://shanmeis-notes.toomwn.xyz/arts.html">artsy</a> stuff.</p>
  <p>I am affiliated with the lovely <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/ranting/the-town.html">OOM Town.</a></p>
  <p>At the moment, my home page is kind of boring... Please enjoy the cherry blossom images while you wait for me to waste and cry and dissipate trying to come up with ideas.</p>

  <h3>Development Status</h3>
  <p>26/7/23 - I added a couple more sections. Behold the <a href="https://shanmeis-notes.toomwn.xyz/arts.html">arts section</a>, where I throw stuff that I create for fun (mostly composing) I also have a class notes section, this you'll have to find yourself since there are no links to it.<br>View full status <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/dev-stat.html">here.</a></p>
