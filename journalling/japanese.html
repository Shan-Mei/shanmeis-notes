  <p>- Learnt new kanji and vocab, and grammar points. We are on the topic of body parts and describing the physical appearance of people.<br>- We still don't have those booklets that we were meant to get. I hope I get them soon so i can catch up on materal.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L1 - 27/2</h4>
  <p>- Learnt more words and grammar again today. I really want my 3rd period of languages back. Now every lesson is learning a new set of words and we have no way to consolidate our knowledge while in class.<br>- We found out the assessment is 2 Fridays later, and we found that we ALSO haven't learnt all of the material required for the assessment... so my class and myself are pretty screwed.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L1 - 13/3</h4>
  <p>- I had the test today. It was very stressful. My heart was beating like crazy because I had just played two intense games of touch rugby the period before and I was trying to fan myself down and couldn't concentrate properly during the listening section.<br>- Yes I know I said it was gonna be on Friday but Karasavas Sensei emailed us last week and told us that it was gonna be today.</p>

We will also spend time in a host family in a sister school. People who go are depended on our behaviour and grades. Basically who Todd Sensei wants to travel with. Year 11s are also given priority, but there may be another tour in 2025 if lots of people want to go.</p>
  <h4>T2W6L1 - 29/5</h4>
  <p>- Turns out our test got changed a fair bit. We now have the whole test in 1 period, next week on Friday.<br>- We got given our writing prompt. We have to write about a matsuri and our experiences at it.</p>
