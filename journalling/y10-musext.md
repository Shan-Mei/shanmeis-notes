  <h4>T2W1L1 - 24/4</h4>
  <p>- Dang I was meant to miss this lesson because of the Anzac rehearsal. However we went to the rehearsal and Ms Christmass told us there was no point in rehearsing because the sound crew wasn't there.<br>- In class, we sang through the sing and sign assessment and Mr Rogers told us about our concert prac stuff.

  <h4>T2W2L2 - 2/5</h4>
  <p>- We had a relief teacher for the period. We got a worksheet and we finished that in the first... 15 minutes. So, we just messed around for the rest of the period. Fun times.</p>

  <h3>Term 1</h3>
  <h4>T1W4L2 - 21/2</h4>
  <p>- Finally received the course ouline. I am happy :D<br>- Did literally nothing. Just remember the bring manuscript next time so I don't have to walk up to the wall of shame with Max.<br>- Oh and if I'm going to write down aug 4th then don't write the interval in a lazy way, and write the FLAT SIGN IN FRONT OF THE EEE</p>
  <h4>T1W4L3 - 23/2</h4>
  <p>- We sang through "Summertime" written by Gershwin.<br>- Listened to "The Gambler" by Johnny Cash as a musical segue.<br>- The normal issues happened, and we made plans for tomorrow's play through</p>
  <h4>T1W4L4 - 24/2</h4>
  <p>- We had the prac. Played through Summertime, but unfortunately, Layla was away. So we were singerless.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L1 - 27/2</h4>
  <p>- We started working through movement 1 of spring by Vivaldi.<br>- Had a little look through IMSLP. I am glad that they do Urtext editions as well. No longer need to pay Henle :D<br>- Homework: find out the story of the first movement of spring.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L3 - 2/3</h4>
  <p>- Mr Rogers fell sick and we had an English teacher as relief. Mrs Roy came to visit our class to check on us and it seems as if the two are quite fond of each other.<br>- We did the worksheet that was sent to us through email. Some funny wording in the worksheets.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L1 - 7/3</h4>
  <p>- Mr Rogers is still sick so our class joined up with Ms Banyard's class. It appears as though she actually teaches her class though, which honestly, I didn't expect.<br>- We got our first composition task - which myself including many many other really really HATE. It's a very not fun melody arrangement task, and we have to basically arrange a given melody for an ensemble. The options are WAM string quartet (I highly doubt the teachers understand how hard it actually is to write for string quartet), Jazz ensemble with no kit and an improvised solo with pre defined "licks." Another option is to do a contemporary band with no kit and we have to make up lyrics for it. It must be in ternary form, with the given melody as the A section, and it must be STUPID HOMOPHONIC. Arghh that's the part I really despise. Oh well.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L2 - 9/3</h4>
  <p>- Mr Rogers still away, we just finished off the Vivaldi booklet. It wasn't fun but I did some stuff. However, half the class (including me) just sung through the Anzac day repertoire for half the period.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L2 - 9/3</h4>
  <p>- We were meant to have the prac today, but unfortunately Mr Rogers still sick. Literally just worked on the composition the whole period.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L1 - 13/3</h4>
  <p>- We listened to Mr Rogers the whole time, we analysed the first movement of Spring. Some of my classmates may have low-key offended Mr Rogers during class.<br>- We argued that Enrico was the hottest guy in the class. I am not gonna comment on that.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L2 - 14/3</h4>
  <p>- Another normal music class. We discussed some general knowledge and did some melodic dictation.<br>- I ended up moving back to the other table.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L3 - 16/3</h4>
  <p>- The norm happened. We discussed tomorrow and listened to some F#.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L4 - 17/3</h4>
  <p>- Played through the ritornello of Spring by Vivaldi. Mr Rogers made us do a really sacrilege version of it by him putting a kit beneath it...</p>
  <h4>T1W8L1 - 20/3</h4>
  <p>- Sang though Deep River. I had to conduct XP. Don't want to do that again.<br>- We also have a test.<br>- Aural content:<br>   - All intervals within the octave, including aug 4th. Going up and down.<br>   - 4 kinds of triads: Major, minor, diminished, augmented. Note: There are only 2 augmented triads<br>   - Chord progrssions major: 1, 4, 5, 5^7, 6.<br>   - Chord progressions minor: 1, 4, 5, 5^7<br>   - Rhythmic and melodic dictation. 4 bars in length. First 2 bars of melodic will include rhythm, the second two will be proper dictation. Heard 5 times</p>
  <h4>T1W8L2 - 21/3</h4>
  <p>- Normal music class. Boring.</p>
  <h4>T1W8L3 - 23/3</h4>
  <p>- Listened to a Schubert string quartet. Very fun.<br>- Theory test details:<br>- Scales, identifying keys, up to 3 sharps and flats. Transfer solfage - staff.<br>- Intervals in a context (in music) including augmented 2nd.<br>- Chords - maj, min, root pos. Roman numerals, with a key.<br>- Cadences - perfect. Perhaps there are supertonic-tonic cadences.<br>- Terminology - tempi, scale degrees</p>
  <h4>T1W8L4 - 24/3</h4>
  <p>- We did the composition task.</p>
  <h4>T1W9L1 - 27/3</h4>
  <p>- Did the music tests with the other class of year 9s. It was very easy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ finished like 20 minutes early. I feel bad for the classmate that didn't know we had the test today.</p>
  <h4>T1W9L2 - 31/3</h4>
  <p>- We submitted our assignments. A bit of kurfuffle with the hard copies and such but it was fine for me.<br>- We started Billie's Blues and he talked us through about why we do set works<br>- We got our tests back.</p>
  <h4>T1W10L3 - 6/4</h4>
  <p>- We found that now we have to write an analysis on our piece we composed. I am not looking forward to this.<br>- We got given our sing and sign assessment, due in week 3. It's two parts, one is in a group and one is by yourself.<br>- We got a Jazz pdf, turns out our class is falling behind :/<br>- We had a little look at Jazz and had a discussion on racism and black influence on white culture.</p>
