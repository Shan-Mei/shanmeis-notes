  <h4>T1W4L2 - 21/2</h4>
  <p>- Learning about financial math - econs lesson??</p>
  <p>- I was searching up some of the vocab Ms Liu was using so I wasn't concentrating, then I got picked on :'( I'm glad it was an easy question and that it was straightforward</p>
  <p>- Turns out theres this thing on Mathspace that gives you stars instead of grading your questions</p>
  <p>- Working on 7.03 and 7.04 on Mathspace</p>
  <p>- Was just announced that the Term 1 test is next week Monday. Time to enslave myself to my grades once again.</p>
  <h4>T1W4L3 - 22/2</h4>
  <p>- Doing compound interest now. I uh don't really get how it works but I know how to do it. But it's ok.</p>
  <p>- I am so worried that in the test, there will be solving for example the squ root of 5. Test says no calculator...</p>
  <p>- Test also got postponed to Tuesday, which means I have an extra day a period to study. Will start studying today.</p>
  <p>- Doing 5.01 mathspace. Can't believe I read the 2nd question wrong 3 times.</p>
  <p>- Teacher called me WanG Shan-Mei (ToT)</p>
  <h4>T1W4L4 - 23/2</h4>
  <p>- Test revision today. Today was the first time Ms Liu actually checked our homework. I glad I did it.</p>
  <p>- Didn't know Mathspace was capable of using vocab such as "depreciate"</p>
  <h4>T1W5L1 - 27/2</h4>
  <p>- Another period of test revision.</p>
  <p>- Learnt some new expanding formulas to aid us in the test.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L2 - 28/2</h4>
  <p>- We had the test today.</p>
  <p>- Goodbye 100%. I know I didn't ace the test already.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L3 - 1/3</h4>
  <p>- Breaking news - we now have an awesome teacher. It's been one day and we have our tests back already!! Unfortunately, I didn't do very well on it.</p>
  <p>- We started adding and dividing and algebraic fractions, doing 1.01 on Mathspace.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L4 - 2/3</h4>
  <p>- We did 1.02 in math and learnt how to divide and multiply algebraic fractions.</p>
  <p>- We also continued with our coding journey on Grok</p>
  <p>- Ms Liu wore some very flowery dress with a very flowery hat which was very very stylish</p>
  <h4>T1W6L1 - 7/3</h4>
  <p>- Did distributive law.</p>
  <p>- Mathspace 2.02 and 2.03 for hw.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L2 - 8/3</h4>
  <p>- Basically just practised.</p>
  <p>- Ms Liu assigned us 2.03 twice .0.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L3 - 9/3</h4>
  <p>- We learnt a little on factorising, and worked on 2.06 mathspace</p>
  <p>- Also did coding for the last 30 minutes.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L1</h4>
  <p>- Practised expanding and factorising. Did a little bit of extention work. Half the class is desperately studying for their languages tests, it's really quite funny to see all the screens on EP.</p>
  <p>- Got picked on. Argh. There are some people that are still yet to be picked on. Hmph.</p>
  <p>- Did textbook questions.</p>
