  <h4>T2W1L4 - 27/4</h4>
  <p>- We went through word problems. Then we worked on the math investigation</p>
  <h4>T2W2L1 - 1/5</h4>
  <p>- We did some practice for word problems. Learnt direct proportion.<br>- Direct proportion is the Mathspace task to do.<br>- Ms Liu has changed the due date of investigation for my class to I don't know what (didn't quite understand her, I will get it clarified). I'm not sure about other classes.</p>
  <h4>T2W2L2 - 2/5</h4>
  <p>- Learnt inverse proportion. Then doing mathspace, and if time, investigation.<br>- I have had the investigation details cleared up. The <b>code</b> is due on <b>Friday night</b>. The <b>powerpoint</b> needs to be submitted by <b>Sunday night</b>. Code is to be submitted via <b><a href="https://codequiry.com/">https://codequiry.com/</a></b> and powerpoint is to be submitted through <b>Connect submission</b>.</p>
  <h4>T2W2L3 - 3/5</h4>
  <p>- We got a whole session to do our coding. However, I used the session to finish my mathspace<br>- Investigation submission method got changed again, we now submit both on Connect</p>
  <h4>T2W2L4 - 4/5</h4>
  <p>- We got yet another lesson to do coding, still finishing mathspace<br>- Our method of submitting got changed YET AGAIN. We now have to submit code onto Grok and a Form, submit the powerpoint via a Form and a special word doc. We also have to fill in Forms on how we coded the project and why we thing Coding is important for us...</p>
  <h4>T2W3L1 - 8/5</h4>
  <p>- Learnt linear functions - parallel and perpendicular lines. Doing ms... but the ms task didn't sync.</p>
  <h4>T2W3L2 - 9/5</h4>
  <p>- Doing parabolas... but no one is quite understanding them... so that's great. Doing MS Parabolas.</p>
  <h4>T2W3L3 - 10/5</h4>
  <p>- We did the math investigation presenting.</p>
  <h4>T2W4L2 - 16/5</h4>
  <p>- Did more parabolas... but I have no idea how the hell to do them.</p>
  <h4>T2W4L3 - 17/5</h4>
  <p>- Got a relief and spent the whole period trying to do the work, but we did not know how to do it.</p>
  <h4>T2W4L4 - 18/5</h4>

  <h4>T2W5L1 - 22/5</h4>
  <p>- Did mathspace, Ms Liu was away.</p>
  <h4>T2W5L2 - 23/5</h4>
  <p>- Learnt about circle formula on graphs.<br>- Turn out over half the class didn't finish their mathspace (I wasn't part of this, I crammed the night before) and they got detention.<br>- Mr White came and talked to us about subject solutions. Turns out semester 1 is year 11 methods unit 1, and semester 2 math is year 11 methods unit 2 and a taster to spec. He explained the significance of learning methods and methods prerequisites for uni, and how much we fall behind on if we don't do second sem methods.</p>
  <h4>T2W5L4 - 25/5</h4>
  <p>- Did hyperbolas. MS 5.10 for practice</p>
  <h4>T2W6L1 - 29/5</h4>
  <p>- There was a fire alarm!! We are not sure whether it was a false or true alarm, but it wasn't a drill. I feel bad for the year 11s and 10s who had exams this morning - to sit through the noise. They didn't evacuate though which slightly concerns me.<br>- We got our investigation back if we wanted them back - I think I did pretty well.<br>- We are doing 9.01 mathspace on surface area.</p>
  <h4>T2W6L2 - 30/5</h4>
  <p>- Doing volume of shapes. Mathspace tasks</p>
  <h4>T2W6L3 - 31/5</h4>
  <p>- Ms Liu is not here today. We are working through the 9.03 lesson and questions.</p>
  <h4>T2W6L4 - 1/6</h4>
  <p>- Revision lesson. Ms Liu literally went through all the topics again and gave us some more tips and tricks.</p>
  <h4>T2W7L4 - 8/6</h4>
  <p>- We did the test, it was very easy. Finished 20 minutes to spare, but I am worried about the exponential dilation question.</p>
  <h4>T2W8L1 - 12/6</h4>
  <p>- We started another python project, this time we get to choose what we do, and in groups.</p>
  <h4>T2W8L3 - 14/6</h4>
  <p>- Did volume of pyramids, and doing 5.05. I am catching up with yesterday's stuff.</p>
  <h4>T2W8L4 - 15/6</h4>
  <p>- We revised congruency. We are working through 7c of the worksheets in compass.</p>
  <h4>T2W9L1 - 19/6</h4>
  <p>- Ms Liu isn't here, we got no new stuff to work on. I just walked myself through the spheres unit.</p>
  <h4>T2W9L2 - 20/6</h4>
  <p>- We got the period to work on coding. Made some progress. Also changed VS Code's theme to catpuccino :D</p>

  <h4>T1W4L2 - 21/2</h4>
  <p>- Learning about financial math - econs lesson??<br>- I was searching up some of the vocab Ms Liu was using so I wasn't concentrating, then I got picked on :'( I'm glad it was an easy question and that it was straightforward<br>- Turns out theres this thing on Mathspace that gives you stars instead of grading your questions<br>- Working on 7.03 and 7.04 on Mathspace<br>- Was just announced that the Term 1 test is next week Monday. Time to enslave myself to my grades once again.</p>
  <h4>T1W4L3 - 22/2</h4>
  <p>- Doing compound interest now. I uh don't really get how it works but I know how to do it. But it's ok.<br>- I am so worried that in the test, there will be solving for example the squ root of 5. Test says no calculator...<br>- Test also got postponed to Tuesday, which means I have an extra day a period to study. Will start studying today.<br>- Doing 5.01 mathspace. Can't believe I read the 2nd question wrong 3 times.<br>- Teacher called me WanG Shan-Mei (ToT)</p>
  <h4>T1W4L4 - 23/2</h4>
  <p>- Test revision today. Today was the first time Ms Liu actually checked our homework. I glad I did it.<br>- Didn't know Mathspace was capable of using vocab such as "depreciate"</p>

Half the class is desperately studying for their languages tests, it's really quite funny to see all the screens on EP.<br>- Got picked on. Argh. There are some people that are still yet to be picked on. Hmph.<br>- Did textbook questions.</p>

  <p>- Did some practice questions and looked at simplifying fractions.<br>- This is the first time ever I have a good grasp on algebra and not falling behind :D<br>- Doing 1.11 Mathspace in class, 1.10 for homework.</p>
  <h4>T1W9L1 - 27/3</h4>
  <p>- Literally just revised algebra - finding the unknown value</p>

  <p>- Doing 3.1 and 3.2 on Mathspace<br>- Ms Liu's not here so we got Burnett instead :/<br>- I need to finish 3.01</p>
  <h4>T1W10L2 - 4/4</h4>
  <p>- Did more stuff on linear equations as added to last year, and put the equations into scenarios.<br>- Doing 3.05 mathspace</p>
  <h4>T1W10L3 - 5/4</h4>
  <p>- Learnt about formulas and subjects in formulas. We also revised and expanded on solving equations. Doing "Week 10 Formulas" mathspace<br>- Gosh I just looked at my mathspace and I have lots to finish :'(</p>
