  <h4>T1W5L3 - 2/3</h4>
  <p>- We worked on Sound 1 in Stile<br>- Unfortunately I was late because there was an accident in Cockburn and our relief teacher was Ms Enslin... and she didn't give my friend and I the easiest time explaining why the kiosk doesn't print out a note.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L1 - 7/3</h4>
  <p>- Worked on Stile, Sound 2<br>- Mr Mort came back!</p>
  <h4>T1W6L2 - 9/3</h4>

  <h4>T1W6L3 - 10/3</h4>
  <p>- Did the science inquiry practice test. Don't think I'll manage to finish the real test in time unfortunately. Gotta write faster.
  </p>
  <h4>T1W7L1 - 13/3</h4>
  <p>- Went through the science cat. The notes on it can be found<a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/notes/year-9/science/t1-cat-task.html"> here</a>. Please do not copy off my notes if you are in my year group :')</p>
  <h4>T1W7L2 - 14/3</h4>
  <p>- Continued with the CAT task.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L3 - 16/3</h4>
  <p>- Got questions answered about Cat Validation and started with Sound Experiment Stile.<br>- I still think this whole science cat is so stupid like we legit got three dependant variables...</p>
  <h4>T1W8L1 - 20/3</h4>
  <p>- Continued with editing the cat task.</p>
  <h4>T1W8L2 - 21/3</h4>
  <p>- We did the validation assessment. I'm surprised I manage to finish it. However, I forgot to convert the units from m/s to l/s. Big mistake but oh well.</p>
  <h4>T1W8L3 - 23/3</h4>
  <p>- Went through the anatomy of the ear and did some practice questions for lead up to test.</p>
  <h4>T1W8L4 - 24/3</h4>
  <p>- Went through anatomy of the eye.</p>
  <h4>T1W9L1 - 27/3</h4>
  <p>- Completed the physics topic test. I completely forgot how to do all the equations...</p>
  <h4>T1W9L2 - 31/3</h4>
  <p>- I got my CAT test back. Some funny things I must have done in it.<br>- We went back through year 7 biology and did some revision.</p>
  <h4>T1W10L1 - 4/4</h4>
  <p>- Got tests back. Didn't do very well. I guess I have the other assessments to redeem myself<br>- As I wasn't here yesterday I went through the first powerpoint. We need to get the Homeostasis worksheet completed by Thursday.</p>
  <h4>T1W10L3 - 6/4</h4>
  <p>- Handed in homework. We got a relief teacher and he was nice so he gave us 10 minutes to finish it :D<br>- Doing Thermoregulation in Stile.</p>
