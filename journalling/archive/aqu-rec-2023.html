  <h3>Term 1</h3>
  <h4>T1W4L1 - 21/2</h4>
  <p>- Our assignment got handed to us. It's about Rottnest Island and safety stuff<br>- I didn't do much, I did section two as my friend did section one (it's a pair assignment if you're wondering)<br>- This is due on the 7th of March.</p>
  <h4>T1W4L2 - 24/2</h4>
  <p>- We got another member, since she's just moved here from photography. As you can expect from a photography and visual art student, she's amazing at design and helped us fixed our very plain powerpoint :D<br>- We finished the task, 1 period early, which is great so we can get feedback next week (if Miss Gunzberg is here at all...)</p>
  <h4>T1W5L1 - 24/2</h4>
  <p>- Our class went down to the river and we did some kayaking and supping! It was very very fun, and nice to learn how to stand up paddle board!</p>
  <h4>T1W6L1 - 7/3</h4>
  <p>- We finished our assignments, and my group had half a period of free time :D because we used our time wisely in class unlike the other groups. Which was very nice since my other two group members had their hass test the next period, and I just got to continue working on my Quartz.<br>- I know I said that it was due today but I didn't know we were supping last Tuesday. So it's due idek when.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L2 - 24/2</h4>
  <p>- We went supping and kayaking again today, very fun. We rowed over 3 km, starting rowing from Wesley College and across the river to Elizabeth Quay :D Unfortuantely, that was our last supping section we get. Very fun though, I got surprise photo'd by Ms Gunzberg as well.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L1 - 14/3</h4>
  <p>- We learnt some snorkelling basics today, and put our theory techniques into action at Beatty Pool park. Very fun.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L2 - 17/3</h4>
  <p>- Got more updates on what we were gonna do in Rottnest. We will be catching the ferry at B-Shed at 9:00 and arriving at 9:30. We will also be doing some swimming and "hanging out" on the different coasts, and we'll also be visiting different places. Finishing the day at 2:00. I almost thought it was gonna be on Tuesday and went oh dangit that's when I have ensembles both before and after school.<br>- We handed in our assignments, and sorted out the snorkelling gear, fins etc. Ms Gunzberg hard yelled at the guys in our class for swearing and not behaving appropriately.</p>
  <h4>T1W8L2 - 24/3</h4>
  <p>- Continued with the original workbooks.</p>
  <h4>T1W9L2 - 31/3</h4>
  <p>- We presented the dangerous creatures powerpoint that we did ages ago. Jenny came and carried our powerpoint design again<br>- I got so scared by some of the animals I swear I'm gonna freak out at Rottnest on Monday.</p>
