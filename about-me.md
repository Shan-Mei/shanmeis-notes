  <h3>More About Music</h3>
  <p>I like western art music a lot. I hate pop - It's so boring. I like jazz but I don't love it. I don't mind rock. I find world music interesting, and I'm a fan of ghibli scores.<br>I am obsessed with Debussy, and I do not like Bartok. There you go Ellie, I said it to the world.<br>I play piano to an Amus (aka diploma or grade 10) standard, I play violin through the school program and I just started oboe. I sing for leisure. I should be buying myself a descant recorder soon, and a fife a little later. I also know how to play horizontal bamboo flute, drumkit, mallet instruments, some auxillary instruments, guzheng and harmonica, all to a very low standard.<br>I do a lot of compositional work. Finished 2 works (That I did willingly, which excludes school assignments) - one oboe solo piece (2022) and a single movement piano concerto (2023)<br>I have perfect pitch. Just finished training octaves. Current goal is training hertz recognition.<br>Current ensemble count: 8</p>
