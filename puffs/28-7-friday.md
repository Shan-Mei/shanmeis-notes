## Puffs Notes 28/7 Friday
Act 1
- In "Scene: Year 2," Diya needs to sound more devastated at the camera clicks
- In "Scene: Year 2," jump up and down when crowding around for duelling club to seem more excited?
- In "Heir of Snakes," start screaming the moment you're  on stage? It's extremely delayed
- In "The Yule-Tide Ball," entrance needs to be much smoother and snappier
- Rollcall needs to be more on rhythm and people need to project more
- In the third task, Stella "He's dead" needs to be sadder or more shocked

Act 2
- "NO ONE IS SAFE" amazing!
- In "The great hall again" year 7 after voldy does the pilates thing can diya wait until blackout to move and not in the middle of the scene, or after the whatsapp scene.
- Puff hi after ellissa confession to be louder?
- In the battle, when Ellissa and Diya go "Wayne?" suggestion is that one is questioning and one is like horrified.

General
- Snappier sounds (though understandable)
- Quiet backstage
- DONT GO DINGALINGALING WE HAVE SOUNDS WHERE THERE ARE SOUNDS
- Quiet footsteps on the set
- Practice moving on stage (behind the set, up stairs) ONLY IN BLACKOUT TIMES
- Especially for group stuff, enter in
